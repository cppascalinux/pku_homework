历史和许可证
************


该软件的历史
============

Python 由荷兰数学和计算机科学研究学会（CWI，见 https://www.cwi.nl/ ）
的 Guido van Rossum 于 1990 年代初设计，作为一门叫做 ABC 的语言的替代
品。尽管 Python 包含了许多来自其他人的贡献，Guido 仍是其主要作者。

1995 年，Guido 在弗吉尼亚州的国家创新研究公司（CNRI，见
https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/ ）继续他在 Python 上的工作，并在那里发
布了该软件的多个版本。

2000 年五月，Guido 和 Python 核心开发团队转到 BeOpen.com 并组建了
BeOpen PythonLabs 团队。 同年十月，PythonLabs 团队转到 Digital
Creations (现为 Zope Corporation；见 https://www.zope.org/)。 2001 年
，Python 软件基金会 (PSF，见 https://www.python.org/psf/) 成立，这是一
个专为拥有 Python 相关知识产权而创建的非营利组织。 Zope Corporation 现
在是 PSF 的赞助成员。

所有的 Python 版本都是开源的（有关开源的定义参阅
https://opensource.org/ ）。历史上，绝大多数 Python 版本是 GPL 兼容的
；下表总结了各个版本情况。

注解:

  GPL 兼容并不意味着 Python 在 GPL 下发布。与 GPL 不同，所有 Python 许
  可证都允许您分发修改后的版本，而无需开源所做的更改。GPL 兼容的许可证
  使得 Python 可以与其它在 GPL 下发布的软件结合使用；但其它的许可证则
  不行。

感谢众多在 Guido 指导下工作的外部志愿者，使得这些发布成为可能。

   Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
   - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
     between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
     version is still 5 times faster, though.
   - Arguments more compliant with Python standard

OpenSSL

如果操作系统可用，则 "hashlib", "posix", "ssl", "crypt" 模块使用
OpenSSL库来提高性能。此外，适用于Python的Windows和Mac OS X安装程序可能
包括OpenSSL库的拷贝，所以在此处也列出了OpenSSL许可证的拷贝:

    See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
    Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
