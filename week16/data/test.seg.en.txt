Macro form of "PyList_GetItem()" without error checking.
The "for" statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal
Set the context pointer inside capsule to context .
Feeding string objects into "update()" is not supported, as hashes work on bytes, not on characters.
Loaders are still used during import but have fewer responsibilities.
Betas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly adding new modules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes except as needed to fix critical bugs.
The code for "permutations()" can be also expressed as a subsequence of "product()", filtered to exclude entries with repeated elements (those from the same position in the input pool):
"FileExistsError" is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ("'x'") already exists.
So our callback function receives pointers to integers, and must return an integer

The RFC specifies that the names within a JSON object should be unique, but does not mandate how repeated names in JSON objects should be handled
If they can't remember the methods for a list, they can do something like this:
Augment the filename for compiled ( bytecode ) files by adding ".opt 2" before the ".pyc" extension (see PEP 488 ).

Using "NotImplemented" in a boolean context has been deprecated, as it is almost exclusively the result of incorrect rich comparator implementations
Make an iterator that returns elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true
The picture is less clear, here, however, since a few common routines are exceptions: "PyTuple_GetItem()", "PyList_GetItem()", "PyDict_GetItem()", and "PyDict_GetItemString()" all return references that you borrow from the tuple, list or dictionary.
If streams were opened in text mode, input must be a string
("len(result)" will equal "size".)
The "StreamHandler" class, located in the core "logging" package, sends logging output to streams such as sys.stdout , sys.stderr or any file like object (or, more precisely, any object which supports "write()" and "flush()" methods).

(Contributed by Raymond Hettinger; see rationale.)
In order to use this macro, the "tp_traverse" implementation must name its arguments exactly visit and arg :
a class instance method: The corresponding user defined function is called, with an argument list that is one longer than the argument list of the call: the instance becomes the first argument.
Changed in version 3.1: Added the ability to use "assertRaises()" as a context manager.
This means that logger instances never need to be passed between different parts of an application.
Turn a 10 tuple as returned by "parsedate_tz()" into a UTC timestamp (seconds since the Epoch)
Also, since the 0.1 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 1/10 and 0.3 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 3/10, then pre rounding with "round()" function cannot help:

Use "StreamWriter" for codecs which have to keep state in order to make encoding efficient.
(In earlier versions it raised a "ValueError".)
Sadly, our help output isn't very informative on the new ability our script has acquired, but that can always be fixed by improving the documentation for our script (e.g. via the "help" keyword argument).

In general, "isinstance()" and "issubclass()" should not be used with types.
The "os._exit()" function can be used if it is absolutely positively necessary to exit immediately (for example, in the child process after a call to "os.fork()").

Creates a "StreamRecoder" instance which implements a two way conversion: encode and decode work on the frontend — the data visible to code calling "read()" and "write()", while Reader and Writer work on the backend — the data in stream .
It will probably be better than your own custom dictionary based approach or even a db_row based solution.

As we can see above, the API is pretty straightforward
Other languages, such as Object Pascal, Delphi, and C++, use static types, so it's possible to know, in an unambiguous way, what member is being assigned to
When creating a module that can raise several distinct errors, a common practice is to create a base class for exceptions defined by that module, and subclass that to create specific exception classes for different error conditions:
"WeakMethod" has special code to recreate the bound method until either the object or the original function dies:
This is the case for objects such as "GzipFile"

Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a code block in order to handle errors or other exceptional conditions
That's because names in the 1st are not yet available, because the first module is busy importing the 2nd.
The attack isn't as efficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering parser countermeasures that forbid deeply nested entities.

zip : ZIP file (unpacking compressed files works only if the corresponding module is available).
All function, type and macro definitions needed to use the Python/C API are included in your code by the following line:
Mailcap entries can contain named parameters like "%{foo}", which will be replaced by the value of the parameter named 'foo'
iterator An object representing a stream of data
In that case, check what address you should be using for a domain socket it's system dependent
If you don't want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:
The "Changelog" is an HTML version of the file built from the contents of the Misc/NEWS.d directory tree, which contains all nontrivial changes to Python for the current version.
This prevents directories with a common name, such as "string", unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path
You can now feed this object with bytes like objects (normally "bytes") using the "update()" method
Remove all elements from the deque leaving it with length 0.
For the "'f'", "'d'" and "'e'" conversion codes, the packed representation uses the IEEE 754 binary32, binary64 or binary16 format (for "'f'", "'d'" or "'e'" respectively), regardless of the floating point format used by the platform.
If the operand is a zero then "Decimal(' Infinity')" is returned and the "DivisionByZero" flag is raised
This operation is identical to the "compare()" method, except that all NaNs signal

The deallocator ("tp_dealloc" handler) should call this for the object before any of the fields used by the "tp_traverse" handler become invalid.
Additionally, maximum character width can be suggested
The "pprint" module provides a capability to "pretty print" arbitrary Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the interpreter

The following string values are defined and implemented by all standard Python codecs:
Even when the requested memory is used exclusively for internal, highly specific purposes, delegating all memory requests to the Python memory manager causes the interpreter to have a more accurate image of its memory footprint as a whole
They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry.
Explicit conversions with "from_float()" or "create_decimal_from_float()" do not set the flag.
Exception raised when non blocking "put()" (or "put_nowait()") is called on a "Queue" object which is full.
For example, using the default implementation of "optionxform()" (which converts option names to lower case), the values "foo %(bar)s" and "foo %(BAR)s" are equivalent.
Each entry in the list must be a string containing the parameter name, an equals sign ("' '"), and the parameter's value

Return the exception of the Task.
The "codeop" module provides utilities upon which the Python read eval print loop can be emulated, as is done in the "code" module
Equality comparison across these types results in inequality, and ordering comparison across these types raises "TypeError".

If an object containing an unsupported type was marshalled with "dump()", "load()" will substitute "None" for the unmarshallable type.
The latter technique also adds some extra methods that may not be found in hand written or built in named tuples.

Many API functions are useful independent of whether you're embedding or extending Python; moreover, most applications that embed Python will need to provide a custom extension as well, so it's probably a good idea to become familiar with writing an extension before attempting to embed Python in a real application.
Now let's suppose we want to store "datetime.datetime" objects not in ISO representation, but as a Unix timestamp.
This constructor should always be called with keyword arguments
For example, the static type checker did not report an error when assigning "a" to "s" even though "s" was declared to be of type "str" and receives an "int" value at runtime!

This calls "rl_insert_text()" in the underlying library, but ignores the return value.
Common examples for decorators are "classmethod()" and "staticmethod()".
If the encoding or errors arguments were specified or the universal_newlines argument was "True", the stream is a text stream, otherwise it is a byte stream
Assigning a new value to instances of the pointer types "c_char_p", "c_wchar_p", and "c_void_p" changes the memory location they point to, not the contents of the memory block (of course not, because Python bytes objects are immutable):
Why is it printing "False"? ctypes instances are objects containing a memory block plus some descriptor s accessing the contents of the memory
The goal of the default "_generate_next_value_()" methods is to provide the next "int" in sequence with the last "int" provided, but the way it does this is an implementation detail and may change.

Else: The object must be an iterable with the same number of items as there are targets in the target list, and the items are assigned, from left to right, to the corresponding targets.
This is an object that has the same methods as the entire module, but uses the Unicode database version 3.2 instead, for applications that require this specific version of the Unicode database (such as IDNA).
For example giving a "str" object to the "write()" method of a binary stream will raise a "TypeError"
If the same attribute name occurs in both an instance and in a class, then attribute lookup prioritizes the instance:
Similar functionality (accepting only text string arguments, but more liberal towards whitespace) is also accessible using the "bytes.fromhex()" class method.
This subtype of "PyObject" represents an opaque value, useful for C extension modules who need to pass an opaque value (as a "void " pointer) through Python code to other C code

The default "random()" returns multiples of 2⁻⁵³ in the range 0.0 ≤ x < 1.0
Therefore, "list.sort()" sorts the list in place
The rules for translating a Unicode string into a sequence of bytes are called a character encoding , or just an encoding .

Graphical User Interfaces with Tk
Note that mapname is first checked if it is an alias to another name.
Therefore, if you change your modules, you must restart the interpreter or, if it's just one module you want to test interactively, use "importlib.reload()", e.g. "import importlib; importlib.reload(modulename)".
On receiving this exception, the generator's code must either raise "GeneratorExit" or "StopIteration"; catching the exception and doing anything else is illegal and will trigger a "RuntimeError"
"IntEnum" values behave like integers in other ways you'd expect:
When the Unicode patterns "[a z]" or "[A Z]" are used in combination with the "IGNORECASE" flag, they will match the 52 ASCII letters and 4 additional non ASCII letters: 'İ' (U+0130, Latin capital letter I with dot above), 'ı' (U+0131, Latin small letter dotless i), 'ſ' (U+017F, Latin small letter long s) and 'K' (U+212A, Kelvin sign)

Search functions are expected to take one argument, being the encoding name in all lower case letters, and return a "CodecInfo" object
pwd is the password used to decrypt encrypted ZIP files.
Note that lock is a keyword only argument.
Also note that optional continuation clauses always begin with a keyword that cannot start a statement, thus there are no ambiguities (the 'dangling "else"' problem is solved in Python by requiring nested "if" statements to be indented).
Determine whether code is in tableC.7 (Inappropriate for canonical representation).
If neither matching host nor default entry is available, return "None".
timeout can either be "None" or a float or int number of seconds to wait for
If a call with blocking set to "True" would block, return "False" immediately; otherwise, set the lock to locked and return "True".

Although certain modules are designed to export only names that follow certain patterns when you use "import ", it is still considered bad practice in production code.
Loads the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free variable storage
The string argument passed to the built in functions "eval()" and "exec()" is a code block.

This feature can be disabled by setting "allow_abbrev" to "False":
Zero and negative years are interpreted as prescribed by the ISO 8601 standard
Note that some platforms may have particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a minimum stack size > 32 KiB or requiring allocation in multiples of the system memory page size platform documentation should be referred to for more information (4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is the suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).

The preferred way to use a Lock is an "async with" statement:
Save the original value of p to avoid losing memory when handling errors.
The sign of the result, if non zero, is the same as that of the original dividend.
It is fairly rare that you must do this, however, so this usage is not yet documented.

It defaults to 1 which means that the default buffer size will be used.
Types which do not store references to other objects, or which only store references to atomic types (such as numbers or strings), do not need to provide any explicit support for garbage collection.
This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.

a number of standard library modules ("audioop", "ast", "grp", "_hashlib", "pwd", "_posixsubprocess", "random", "select", "struct", "termios", "zlib") are now using the stable ABI defined by PEP 384.
The hook should expect either a string or bytes object; the encoding of bytes objects is up to the hook (e.g. it may be a file system encoding, UTF 8, or something else), and if the hook cannot decode the argument, it should raise "ImportError".
Note in particular that options (such as input ) and arguments (such as eggs.txt ) that are separated by whitespace in the shell go in separate list elements, while arguments that need quoting or backslash escaping when used in the shell (such as filenames containing spaces or the echo command shown above) are single list elements.
The standard bytes to bytes codecs do not support this method.
(Contributed by Juliette Monsel in bpo 34829.)
Formal parameters using the syntax " identifier" or " identifier" cannot be used as positional argument slots or as keyword argument names.
Parameters not specified keep current settings, except "errors 'strict'" is used when encoding is specified but errors is not specified.

If the number of backslashes is odd, the last backslash escapes the next double quotation mark as described in rule 3.
It is indeed trivial to modify the above example to run several commands simultaneously:
See section The contextlib module for more about this module.
Note that due to the usual issues with binary floating point (see Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations), the argument to "Fraction(1.1)" is not exactly equal to 11/10, and so "Fraction(1.1)" does not return "Fraction(11, 10)" as one might expect
A slightly more advanced use of the reader catching and reporting errors:
"eval()" also has the effect of interpreting numbers as Python expressions, so that e.g. "eval('09')" gives a syntax error because Python does not allow leading '0' in a decimal number (except '0').

A subclass of "ConnectionError", raised when trying to write on a pipe while the other end has been closed, or trying to write on a socket which has been shutdown for writing
This response is a file like object, which means you can for example call ".read()" on the response:
Windows still uses legacy encodings for the system encoding (the ANSI Code Page)
By default, every key is required to be present
"argparse" supports silencing the help entry for certain options, by setting the "help" value to "argparse.SUPPRESS":
If this is the last call to "decode()" final must be true (the default is false)
Changed in version 3.4: Raise "ImportError" when called instead of "NotImplementedError"
If onerror is provided, it must be a callable that accepts three parameters: function , path , and excinfo .
Raised when the interpreter finds an internal error, but the situation does not look so serious to cause it to abandon all hope
Padding is only automatically added between successive structure members
Raises a "ValueError" if called more times than there were items placed in the queue.
Handlers send the log records (created by loggers) to the appropriate destination.
These may not be available on all platforms when used with the "strftime()" method
Note that three of the handlers ("StreamHandler", "FileHandler" and "NullHandler") are actually defined in the "logging" module itself, but have been documented here along with the other handlers.
Free variables used in the nested function can access the local variables of the function containing the def
The Python Standard Library documents the existing object types, functions and modules (both built in and written in Python) that give the language its wide application range.

All calls to this function with a given name return the same logger instance
This function returns the path to byte compiled file, i.e. whatever cfile value was used.
Function keys, keypad keys and other special keys return a multibyte string containing the key name
With "mode 'w'", a writable file handle is returned, which supports the "write()" method

Exception raised for errors that are related to the database's operation and not necessarily under the control of the programmer, e.g. an unexpected disconnect occurs, the data source name is not found, a transaction could not be processed, etc
Compiling and Linking under Unix like systems
Changed in version 3.7.2: The invalidation_mode parameter's default value is updated to None.
On Linux, you can verify if the SystemTap static markers are present in the built binary by seeing if it contains a ".note.stapsdt" section.
Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, "Path" objects are also accepted for the filename argument.

If exception information is present, it is not sent to the server.
First, here are a list of things to remember before diving further:
In the "MyClass" example, this will return the string "'hello world'"
If the name of this method starts with "get", it will be available on all section proxies, in the dict compatible form (see the "getdecimal()" example above).
This works because regular dicts have guaranteed ordering since Python 3.7
To use a custom "JSONDecoder" subclass, specify it with the "cls" kwarg; otherwise "JSONDecoder" is used
The modules described in this chapter provide interfaces to operating system features that are available on (almost) all operating systems, such as files and a clock
An abstract method that executes the module in its own namespace when a module is imported or reloaded
If the bytes cannot be locked, "OSError" is raised.
(Contributed by Steve Dower in bpo 37834.)
Methods are always bound to an instance of a user defined class
"x > y" and "not x < y" (for total ordering)
For example, "3" and "5" are both positional arguments in the following calls:
When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked, and return
We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using:
Delete all occurrences of the field with name name from the message's headers
Excursus: Setting environment variables
Raised when a payload is added to a "Message" object using "add_payload()", but the payload is already a scalar and the message's Content Type main type is not either multipart or missing
(default: "True") If true, then words longer than "width" will be broken in order to ensure that no lines are longer than "width"
This module defines a number of classes, which are detailed in the sections below.
"dbm.dumb" Portable DBM implementation
This should only contain whitespace characters, and by default contains all whitespace characters in ASCII.
I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the ABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about language design
Using the Python issue tracker
Before, those were reversed.
Once awoken (and the counter is greater than 0), decrement the counter by 1 and return "True"
Otherwise, enough words are dropped from the end so that the remaining words plus the "placeholder" fit within "width":
Class derived from "Error"
To get fine grained control over the copied region, the second form of "overwrite()" can be used
The "check" command allows you to verify if your package meta data meet the minimum requirements to build a distribution.
The standard format of the "TZ" environment variable is (whitespace added for clarity):
Return the length of the bytes in bytes object o .
Changes in 'python' Command Behavior
The firstline flag indicates that it would be sufficient to only return the first line, if there are decoding errors on later lines.
For floating point numbers the result is "(q, a % b)", where q is usually "math.floor(a / b)" but may be 1 less than that
The easiest way to do it in C is to call "PyRun_InteractiveLoop()" (perhaps in a separate thread) and let the Python interpreter handle the input for you
It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language reference document the implementation may change, and other implementations of the same language may work differently
Inheritance of File Descriptors
"fnmatch" Unix filename pattern matching
In addition, for "'g'" and "'G'" conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result.
Hash objects with different digest sizes have completely different outputs (shorter hashes are not prefixes of longer hashes); BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s produce different outputs even if the output length is the same:
The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references
This subtype of "PyObject" represents a Python bytes object.
The signal corresponding to the "Ctrl+C" keystroke event
Subclass of RawTurtle, has the same interface but draws on a default "Screen" object created automatically when needed for the first time.
For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to "eval()", otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with additional information often including the name and address of the object
Like "map()" except that the elements of the iterable are expected to be iterables that are unpacked as arguments.
See "LZMADecompressor" above for a description of the format , memlimit and filters arguments.
How can my code discover the name of an object?
Patches adding support for these would be welcome; see the Python Developer's Guide to learn more about submitting patches to Python.
The constants are the same that with "poll()" object
If later portions of the pattern don't match, the matching engine will then back up and try again with fewer repetitions.
Note that the output of "putp()" always goes to standard output.
When the number of data points is odd, the middle data point is returned:
As with any other mechanism that completely suppresses exceptions, this context manager should be used only to cover very specific errors where silently continuing with program execution is known to be the right thing to do.
image Specifies the item image, in case the item's image option is empty.
New in version 3.6: The thread_name_prefix argument was added to allow users to control the "threading.Thread" names for worker threads created by the pool for easier debugging.
Value Meaning "'r'" Open existing database for reading only (default) "'w'" Open existing database for reading and writing "'c'" Open database for reading and writing, creating it if it doesn't exist "'n'" Always create a new, empty database, open for reading and writing
If loading fails, the failing module and only the failing module gets removed from "sys.modules"
The name "_" is often used in conjunction with internationalization; refer to the documentation for the "gettext" module for more information on this convention.
Running scripts with a GUI
This document covers using the Distutils to distribute your Python modules, concentrating on the role of developer/distributor: if you're looking for information on installing Python modules, you should refer to the Installing Python Modules (Legacy version) chapter.
This section shows recipes and best practices for using "secrets" to manage a basic level of security.
Changed in version 3.7: Introduced the optional "get_resource_reader()" method.
Changed in version 3.7: "BytesWarning" no longer appears in the default filter list and is instead configured via "sys.warnoptions" when " b" is specified twice.
This class deals with parsing and interpreter state (the user's namespace); it does not deal with input buffering or prompting or input file naming (the filename is always passed in explicitly)
Introduced by PEP 492 .
We would still like to know about all commercial use of Python, of course.
member may be a filename or a "TarInfo" object
While "IntEnum" is part of the "enum" module, it would be very simple to implement independently:
Optional parameters w , l , and c are for date column width, lines per week, and number of spaces between month columns, respectively
Within the limits of the types involved, they compare mathematically (algorithmically) correct without loss of precision.
However, they still use the strict error handler by default so that attempting to open a binary file in text mode is likely to raise an exception rather than producing nonsense data.

Macro form of "PyList_Size()" without error checking.
When the "PyArg_Parse ()" functions fail due to conversion failure in one of the format units, the variables at the addresses corresponding to that and the following format units are left untouched.
Example of simulating Python's internal lookup chain:
On Unix, you would not pass "A.a" to the linker for "B.so" and "C.so"; that would cause it to be included twice, so that B and C would each have their own copy
Configuring one of these locales (either explicitly or via the above implicit locale coercion) automatically enables the "surrogateescape" error handler for "sys.stdin" and "sys.stdout" ("sys.stderr" continues to use "backslashreplace" as it does in any other locale)

If hkey is not closed using this method (or via "hkey.Close()"), it is closed when the hkey object is destroyed by Python.
Please refer to the implementation specific documentation to determine what else you need to know about the specific implementation you're using.
Function prototypes are similar to function prototypes in C; they describe a function (return type, argument types, calling convention) without defining an implementation
Changed in version 3.5: Added support for the "xztar" format.
Get information on the specified clock as a namespace object
The "__iadd__" succeeds, and thus the list is extended, but even though "result" points to the same object that "a_tuple[0]" already points to, that final assignment still results in an error, because tuples are immutable.
fd is the file descriptor to which any initialization sequences will be sent; if not supplied or " 1", the file descriptor for "sys.stdout" will be used.
Building and packaging the project
Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C

If the target function fails, then the error_callback is called with the exception instance.
Read n items (as machine values) from the file object f and append them to the end of the array
A new class derived from "Enum" is returned
Often this isn't because they're difficult to implement, but because no one has needed them yet
Similarly, when a help message is requested from a subparser, only the help for that particular parser will be printed
The "mmap.flush()" method now returns "None" on success and raises an exception on error under all platforms
It defines the following items:
Functions may therefore consume all of the iterator's output, and if you need to do something different with the same stream, you'll have to create a new iterator.
"concurrent.futures" Launching parallel tasks
Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like
This allows you to type python to run the interpreter, and pip for the package installer
The lock is initially unlocked.
New in version 3.7.
The other advantage of weakref based finalizers is that they can be used to register finalizers for classes where the definition is controlled by a third party, such as running code when a module is unloaded:
Write the output of the infile to the given outfile
Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestamp, such as is returned by "time.time()"
When 2 digit years are parsed, they are converted according to the POSIX and ISO C standards: values 69 99 are mapped to 1969 1999, and values 0 68 are mapped to 2000 2068.
parse_float , if specified, will be called with the string of every JSON float to be decoded
The exponent of the result is zero, regardless of the exponents of "x", "y" and "modulo"
It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one by one until one is found to be true (see section Boolean operations for the definition of true and false); then that suite is executed (and no other part of the "if" statement is executed or evaluated)
This setting mirrors the parameter of the same name in "fileConfig()"
The following additional characters may be appended to the flag to control how the database is opened:
Display a vertical line starting at "(y, x)" with length n consisting of the character ch .
For "copytree()", the exception argument is a list of 3 tuples ( srcname , dstname , exception ).
Return the angle between the line from turtle position to position specified by (x,y), the vector or the other turtle
The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.
To take care of finalization, an event loop should define a finalizer function which takes an asynchronous generator iterator and presumably calls "aclose()" and executes the coroutine
New in version 3.4.
Release date: 2017 10 16
If the script name refers directly to a Python file, the directory containing that file is added to the start of "sys.path", and the file is executed as the "__main__" module.
The function is equivalent to "HMAC(key, msg, digest).digest()", but uses an optimized C or inline implementation, which is faster for messages that fit into memory
This is always the dictionary of the current module (inside a function or method, this is the module where it is defined, not the module from which it is called).
It is faster than "floor(sqrt(n))" but slower than "math.sqrt()":
Previously, a "RuntimeError" was raised.
and recalling that J has exactly 53 bits (is "> 2 52" but "< 2 53"), the best value for N is 56:
Format Description filename Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified filename, rather than a StreamHandler
This means that if you start reading this manual from the start, and skip to the next chapter when you get bored, you will get a reasonable overview of the available modules and application areas that are supported by the Python library
That is why when your application does not need values with empty lines, you should consider disallowing them
Trying these methods will soon clarify their meaning:
Deprecated since version 3.4: Due to lack of usage, the formatter module has been deprecated.
we can see that in this case "x" and "y" are not equal anymore
A large variance indicates that the data is spread out; a small variance indicates it is clustered closely around the mean.

An element will be discarded when no strong reference to it exists any more.
A negative timeout is equivalent to a zero timeout.
One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX "shebang" line
As a special case, for temporary buffers that are wrapped by "PyMemoryView_FromBuffer()" or "PyBuffer_FillInfo()" this field is "NULL"
New in version 3.6: Added the timespec argument.
For example, the expression "11 // 4" evaluates to "2" in contrast to the "2.75" returned by float true division
Third party modules such as PyGame are also helpful in extending the students' reach.
"ArgumentParser" objects do not allow two actions with the same option string
Return "Py_True" from a function, properly incrementing its reference count.
Most exceptions are defined with names that end in "Error", similar to the naming of the standard exceptions.

Calling "PyEval_InitThreads()" now does nothing
There is no "PyNone_Check()" function for the same reason.
Previously some scripts unconditionally used "__VENV_PROMPT__", others only if it happened to be set (which was the default case), and one used "__VENV_NAME__" instead

As it is not a true field, it is not returned by the module level "fields()" function
( PEP 342 explains the exact rules, which are that a "yield" expression must always be parenthesized except when it occurs at the top level expression on the right hand side of an assignment
When fileobj is not "None", the filename argument is only used to be included in the gzip file header, which may include the original filename of the uncompressed file
The macros for checking for a particular object type ("Pytype_Check()") don't check for "NULL" pointers again, there is much code that calls several of these in a row to test an object against various different expected types, and this would generate redundant tests
The "get_instructions()" function and "Bytecode" class provide details of bytecode instructions as "Instruction" instances:
The following example demonstrates the use of a pool:
The integer length , if given, is the buffer size
This is also known as passing parameters by reference .
With pickle protocol version 4 it is possible to easily pickle enums nested in other classes.
