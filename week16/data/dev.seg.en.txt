Transform a method into a single dispatch generic function .
The modules described in this chapter provide mechanisms for networking and inter processes communication.
The reason for the exception should be immediately clear: "1" is added to the object "a_tuple[0]" points to ("1"), producing the result object, "2", but when we attempt to assign the result of the computation, "2", to element "0" of the tuple, we get an error because we can't change what an element of a tuple points to.

Tests
By default, attempting to create a network object with host bits set will result in "ValueError" being raised
Build
Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.

For example, the relative weights "[10, 5, 30, 5]" are equivalent to the cumulative weights "[10, 15, 45, 50]"
No matter how many digits you're willing to write down, the result will never be exactly 1/3, but will be an increasingly better approximation of 1/3.

In our example, we display more info for each file instead of just showing the file names
Build and C API Changes
Using "object" would look like:
Data written to the wrapped file is decoded according to the given data_encoding and then written to the original file as bytes using file_encoding
For example, they could be incorporated into logged messages
The C string indicates the cause of the error and is converted to a Python string object and stored as the "associated value" of the exception.
The data read is buffered in memory, so do not use this method if the data size is large or unlimited.
For example, to create and populate an "ast.UnaryOp" node, you could use
The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted
If optional argument tz is "None" or not specified, this is like "today()", but, if possible, supplies more precision than can be gotten from going through a "time.time()" timestamp (for example, this may be possible on platforms supplying the C "gettimeofday()" function).

[ Footnotes ]
The profiler modules are designed to provide an execution profile for a given program, not for benchmarking purposes (for that, there is "timeit" for reasonably accurate results)
Such leaks, once introduced, often go undetected for a long time: the error exit is taken only in a small fraction of all calls, and most modern machines have plenty of virtual memory, so the leak only becomes apparent in a long running process that uses the leaking function frequently
Raises an auditing event "winreg.LoadKey" with arguments "key", "sub_key", "file_name".

This function is roughly equivalent to the following code, except that the actual implementation does not build up intermediate results in memory:
In a text file, there is no standard way to distinguish "sys.stderr" from the literal string "'sys.stderr'"

To make it easier to specify the format of input and output records, specific formatting parameters are grouped together into dialects
For example:
(Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in bpo 40824.)
If you want to use no fillcolor (i.e. make the turtle transparent), you have to write "fillcolor """ (but all nonempty strings must not have quotes in the cfg file).
The following example depicts a potentially more convenient pattern for using "SharedMemoryManager" objects via the "with" statement to ensure that all shared memory blocks are released after they are no longer needed:
The directory named by the "TMPDIR" environment variable.
"netrc" netrc file processing
One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for quite some time is IPython, which features tab completion, object exploration and advanced history management
Note that both keys and values of the dictionary are arbitrary arrays of bytes.
The XML format for plist files.
The name can be passed to the constructor, and read or changed through the "name" attribute.
"RawTurtle" (alias: "RawPen") defines Turtle objects which draw on a "TurtleScreen"
If given, extra_args is a sequence of "(name, value)" pairs that will be used as extra keywords arguments when the archiver callable is used.

To assist with the life cycle management of shared memory especially across distinct processes, a "BaseManager" subclass, "SharedMemoryManager", is also provided in the "multiprocessing.managers" module.
This technique is simpler and faster than an equivalent technique using "dict.setdefault()":
Meta path finders must implement a method called "find_spec()" which takes three arguments: a name, an import path, and (optionally) a target module
Compare the files named f1 and f2 , returning "True" if they seem equal, "False" otherwise.
Then the following version specific directories are added to "sys.path", in this order:

If the regex pattern is expressed in bytes, this is equivalent to the class "[a zA Z0 9_]"
For example, "tuple([1, 2, 3])" yields "(1, 2, 3)" and "tuple('abc')" yields "('a', 'b', 'c')"

(Implemented by Marc André Lemburg.)
It is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments
Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it
Calls to the primary constructor will always return objects that compare identically; put another way, barring cache invalidation via "ZoneInfo.clear_cache()", for all values of "key", the following assertion will always be true:
Return a value equal to the first operand after rounding and having the exponent of the second operand.
New in version 3.6.1: The filenames parameter accepts a path like object .
Strictly, these definitions imply that it's meaningless to say 'this is character "U+265E"'
It is not triggered within C functions.
Thus, you could use either "WatchedFileHandler" (relative to the logging module) or "mypackage.mymodule.MyHandler" (for a class defined in package "mypackage" and module "mymodule", where "mypackage" is available on the Python import path).

You can also write your own debugger by using the code for pdb as an example.
Paint at most n characters of the character string str at "(y, x)" with attributes attr , overwriting anything previously on the display.
Unlike "PyMarshal_ReadObjectFromFile()", this function assumes that no further objects will be read from the file, allowing it to aggressively load file data into memory so that the de serialization can operate from data in memory rather than reading a byte at a time from the file

Other objects
In its simplest form you create a Request object that specifies the URL you want to fetch
A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the "sorted()" function
The limit argument sets the buffer limit for "StreamReader" wrappers for "Process.stdout" and "Process.stderr" (if "subprocess.PIPE" is passed to stdout and stderr arguments).
Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the "IncrementalEncoder" object.
The response returned by urlopen (or the "HTTPError" instance) has two useful methods "info()" and "geturl()" and is defined in the module "urllib.response"..
Note that the unusual handling of cumulative times in this profiler allows statistics for recursive implementations of algorithms to be directly compared to iterative implementations.
If "find_spec()" is defined then backwards compatible functionality is provided.
This means that if you need other datatypes, you should convert on your own:
Processing of the configuration will be as for any logger, except that the "propagate" setting will not be applicable.
If capture is "False", the redirection of warnings to the logging system will stop, and warnings will be redirected to their original destinations (i.e. those in effect before "captureWarnings(True)" was called).

While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical analysis
An optional keyword only context argument allows specifying a custom "contextvars.Context" for the callback to run in
Or, of course, you can construct the dictionary in Python code, receive it in pickled form over a socket, or use whatever approach makes sense for your application.

This function provides the same capabilities as the ".dump" command in the sqlite3 shell.
The final items of the iterable are assigned to the targets after the starred target
This is a compatibility alias for the builtin "BlockingIOError" exception.
Other Objects
Raises an auditing event "open" with arguments "file", "mode", "flags".
Learning about descriptors not only provides access to a larger toolset, it creates a deeper understanding of how Python works and an appreciation for the elegance of its design.
Pickle serialization
"close()" will also be called by Python's garbage collector when the generator is garbage collected.
Attr Objects
All identifiers are converted into the normal form NFKC while parsing; comparison of identifiers is based on NFKC.
Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path like object .
Another key feature is that the local variables and execution state are automatically saved between calls
If the added part has no Content Disposition header, add one with the value "attachment"

Unicode Character Properties
Currently, there is only one module in this package:
"Text" Text and CDATASection Objects Nodes containing textual content from the document
It allows you to enter REs and strings, and displays whether the RE matches or fails
Changed in version 3.8: If the queue is closed, "ValueError" is raised instead of "OSError".
Certain objects available in Python wrap access to an underlying memory array or buffer
If the optional argument header is present and true, spaces will be encoded as underscores per RFC 1522
You can go quite far just with what we've learned so far, and we have only scratched the surface
If the optional "infile" and "outfile" arguments are not specified, "sys.stdin" and "sys.stdout" will be used respectively:
Resources limitations
Changed in version 3.6: decode_data is now "False" by default.
So if a loader can load from a cached module but otherwise does not load from a file, that atypical scenario may be appropriate.
Note that if you want to send data to the process's stdin, you need to create the Popen object with "stdin PIPE"
Examples
Note that tabs and spaces are both treated as whitespace, but they are not equal: the lines "" hello"" and ""\thello"" are considered to have no common leading whitespace.
Normally, files are opened in text mode , that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding
For instance, in our example the "'CompressionLevel'" key was specified only in the "'DEFAULT'" section
In addition to "send()", there are two other methods on generators:
option and value must be strings; if not, "TypeError" is raised.
giving one of the optional arguments: "ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)"
What's New in Python 2.6
If passing a single string, either shell must be "True" (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments.
Note:
Parsing comments:
Return "True" if the object argument appears callable, "False" if not

In particular, unnecessary file descriptors and handles from the parent process will not be inherited
Changed in version 3.2: Can be used as a context manager.
Example:
New in version 3.3.
The "setUp()" and "tearDown()" methods allow you to define instructions that will be executed before and after each test method
However, storing a value in a container proxy (which triggers a "__setitem__" on the proxy object) does propagate through the manager and so to effectively modify such an item, one could re assign the modified value to the container proxy:
Case is significant.

This example uses the "time()" function, which returns system time in seconds since the Unix epoch, and the "GetModuleHandleA()" function, which returns a win32 module handle.
Computes the datetime2 such that datetime2 + timedelta datetime1
Changes since Python 3.0
Warning:
Remember that by default, if an optional argument isn't specified, it gets the "None" value, and that cannot be compared to an int value (hence the "TypeError" exception).
Cross Platform
Sometimes, for example when dealing with a particularly long argument lists, it may make sense to keep the list of arguments in a file rather than typing it out at the command line
Tkinter Dialogs
In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module's attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace! [1]
The modules described in this chapter provide numeric and math related functions and data types

ProtocolError Objects
This function uses a cache for past comparisons and the results, with cache entries invalidated if the "os.stat()" information for the file changes
If the Future has been cancelled , this method raises a "CancelledError" exception.
Changed in version 3.7.1: The SAX parser no longer processes general external entities by default to increase security by default
The following tokens are operators:

Applies the logical operation xor between each operand's digits.
The event is output using a 'handler of last resort', stored in "logging.lastResort"
Backreferences like this aren't often useful for just searching through a string there are few text formats which repeat data in this way but you'll soon find out that they're very useful when performing string substitutions.

Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using backslash characters ("\"), as follows: when a physical line ends in a backslash that is not part of a string literal or comment, it is joined with the following forming a single logical line, deleting the backslash and the following end of line character
Alternate Implementations
For many uses of "functools.reduce()", though, it can be clearer to just write the obvious "for" loop:
Legal coordinates will then extend from "(0,0)" to "(curses.LINES 1, curses.COLS 1)".

Shell and Output windows also have the following.
This is the equivalent of the Python expression "o1 ^ o2".
This is an important difference compared with "poll()".
Returns o on success, or "NULL" on failure
Common issues
These functions take the same arguments as the corresponding pattern method with the RE string added as the first argument, and still return either "None" or a match object instance.
It is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the global scope of a function defined in a module is that module's namespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is called
To work with plist data in bytes objects, use "dumps()" and "loads()".
Originally designed and written by Jim Roskind.
The problem with this approach is that a class had to be explicitly marked to support them, which is unpythonic and unlike what one would normally do in idiomatic dynamically typed Python code
ctypes data types that are not and do not contain pointers can now be pickled.
However, some Unices may not have the env command, so you may need to hardcode "/usr/bin/python3" as the interpreter path.

Currently, the only supported value is "DEFLATED".
The risks are limited to where multiple users with no mutual trust run code on the same machine; see the "listen()" documentation for more information.
"importlib.import_module()" is provided to support applications that determine dynamically the modules to be loaded.
Tests
If "home" is an absolute path and "PYTHONHOME" is not set, this path is used instead of the path to the main executable when deducing the home location.
This object has no methods
(Loggers do not need to have different types for different instances, so there is no support in this configuration schema for user defined logger classes.)
Error Output Redirection and Program Termination
pwd is the password used for encrypted files and, if specified, it will override the default password set with "setpassword()"

They provide a dynamic view on the dictionary’s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes
Listing the files in the resulting archive gives us:

However, if the value is "None", then a "ModuleNotFoundError" is raised
Ultimately, the loader is what makes use of "__file__" and/or "__cached__"
(The variables of the module code block are local and global.) If a variable is used in a code block but not defined there, it is a free variable .
The "WatchedFileHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module, is a "FileHandler" which watches the file it is logging to

If blocking is false executes the scheduled events due to expire soonest (if any) and then return the deadline of the next scheduled call in the scheduler (if any).
Functions don't depend on system state that needs to be replicated before running a test; instead you only have to synthesize the right input and then check that the output matches expectations.

Message object structures can be created in one of two ways: they can be created from whole cloth by creating an "EmailMessage" object, adding headers using the dictionary interface, and adding payload(s) using "set_content()" and related methods, or they can be created by parsing a serialized representation of the email message.
When comment_prefixes is given, it will be used as the set of substrings that prefix comments in otherwise empty lines

Otherwise (TOS is false), TOS is popped.
Split the pathname path into a pair "(root, ext)" such that "root + ext path", and ext is empty or begins with a period and contains at most one period
If a handler decides to actually dispatch an event, the "emit()" method is used to send the message to its destination
This means that all symbols in extension modules should be declared "static", except for the module's initialization function, in order to avoid name clashes with other extension modules (as discussed in section The Module's Method Table and Initialization Function)

The following exceptions are subclasses of "OSError", they get raised depending on the system error code.
When packing a value "x" using one of the integer formats ("'b'", "'B'", "'h'", "'H'", "'i'", "'I'", "'l'", "'L'", "'q'", "'Q'"), if "x" is outside the valid range for that format then "struct.error" is raised.

Interpolation behaviour may be customized by providing a custom handler through the interpolation argument
For instance, for the tag "<A HREF "https://www.cwi.nl/">", this method would be called as "handle_starttag('a', [('href', 'https://www.cwi.nl/')])".
Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right
See http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert 2011 003.html for details.
Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses)

The package name you supply will then be imported and its location on the filesystem will be used as the start directory.
"a ixor(a, b)" is equivalent to "a ^ b".
Simple statements
If mutability is desired, you could use lists instead of tuples
The key function patterns shown above are very common, so Python provides convenience functions to make accessor functions easier and faster

For the purposes of this discussion, we can say that the logger represents the source, and the handler the destination, of a connection between the two
For a general character pointer that may also point to binary data, "POINTER(c_char)" must be used

Error Handling
How this value is computed depends on the type of the callable object.
Named tuple instances do not have per instance dictionaries, so they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples.
The "os" module provides dozens of functions for interacting with the operating system:
Core and Builtins
Assign a ctypes type to specify the result type of the foreign function
This allows defining adapters that can adapt custom objects as function parameters.
This chapter describes some things you've learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.
Note that no external programs are called from this function, giving it portability and efficiency.
Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of "MyClass.i" by assignment

There are actually two parser interfaces available for use, the "Parser" API and the incremental "FeedParser" API
Any of the values may be "NULL", in which case the "None" will be used for the corresponding attribute
For example, returning a list of integers could be done by setting "self.count" to 0, and having the "__next__()" method increment "self.count" and return it
The default argument specifies an object to return if the provided iterable is empty

While a language specification need not prescribe how the language interpreter is invoked, it is useful to have a notion of a complete Python program
This sort of thing can only be explained by example, so here's a minimal, but complete, module that defines a new type named "Custom" inside a C extension module "custom":
In AIFF files, compression is not possible
Setting the "default_factory" to "set" makes the "defaultdict" useful for building a dictionary of sets:
fd is the file descriptor, and event is a bitmask with bits set for the reported events for that descriptor "POLLIN" for waiting input, "POLLOUT" to indicate that the descriptor can be written to, and so forth
In this case, the solution is to use the non greedy qualifiers " ?", "+?", "??", or "{m,n}?", which match as little text as possible

TypedDict uses only string keys
New in version 3.3.
Operation Result "date2 date1 timedelta" date2 is "timedelta.days" days removed from date1
(Actually, the first three errors are detected by the parser; only the last error is found by the lexical analyzer the indentation of "return r" does not match a level popped off the stack.)

Create a shared "threading.RLock" object and return a proxy for it.
By default, the result of packing a given C struct includes pad bytes in order to maintain proper alignment for the C types involved; similarly, alignment is taken into account when unpacking
To get interpolation, use "ConfigParser":
For example, if you have a top level module "foo.py" that imports another module "xyz.py", when you run "foo" (by typing "python foo.py" as a shell command), a ".pyc" will be created for "xyz" because "xyz" is imported, but no ".pyc" file will be created for "foo" since "foo.py" isn't being imported.
The presence and type of the argument depend on the exception type.
User defined objects
"None" (the default) selects the most compact representation
If both cancel_futures and wait are "True", all futures that the executor has started running will be completed prior to this method returning
The first is only used as input, and must be a "const char " which points to the name of an encoding as a NUL terminated string, or "NULL", in which case "'utf 8'" encoding is used

Pure Embedding
Call the function "PyRun_String()" from the previous question with the start symbol "Py_eval_input"; it parses an expression, evaluates it and returns its value.
The default raw memory allocator uses the following functions: "malloc()", "calloc()", "realloc()" and "free()"; call "malloc(1)" (or "calloc(1, 1)") when requesting zero bytes.

Power and logarithmic functions
Handlers have the following attributes and methods
Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation.
Return a 3 tuple, containing the R,G,B values for the given color, which will be between "0" (no component) and "1000" (maximum amount of component).
If kwargs is "None" (the default) then an empty dict will be used.
If you want to write code that will work with any Python implementation, you should explicitly close the file or use the "with" statement; this will work regardless of memory management scheme:

If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is not interactive, multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy the byte count (unless EOF is reached first)
While it is possible to use "RawConfigParser" (or "ConfigParser" with raw parameters set to true) for internal storage of non string values, full functionality (including interpolation and output to files) can only be achieved using string values.
Other common values are "'w'" for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), "'x'" for exclusive creation and "'a'" for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position)

Before we conclude, you probably want to tell your users the main purpose of your program, just in case they don't know:
Because the format depends on the current locale, care should be taken when making assumptions about the output value
This permits nesting of these managed lists, dicts, and other Proxy Objects:

Searching Sorted Lists
If file_or_dir is an ordinary Python source file, it is checked for whitespace related problems
In general (and especially on systems without overallocation), it is recommended to estimate even tighter bounds and set the "Inexact" trap if all calculations are expected to be exact.
Calling this method on a bytes like object is equivalent to wrapping bytes in a "BytesIO" instance first and calling "parse()".
Complex numbers are represented as a pair of floating point numbers and have the same restrictions on their range
Here is an example:
The "curses" module defines named constants for each of these colors: "curses.COLOR_BLACK", "curses.COLOR_RED", and so forth.
The context must be adapted for exact arbitrary precision arithmetic

The file is created securely, using the same rules as "mkstemp()"
in the manager's process.
The result is an unsigned 32 bit integer
The buffer interface is documented in Buffer Protocol.
"mkstemp()" returns a tuple containing an OS level handle to an open file (as would be returned by "os.open()") and the absolute pathname of that file, in that order.
This initializes a mostly hidden helper class used by the shadow class.
If queue is empty, wait until an item is available.

Random numbers
Setting this makes the SQLite interface parse the column name for each column it returns
This may be the case if objects such as files, sockets or classes are included, as well as many other objects which are not representable as Python literals.
Replacing shell pipeline
If you wish to retrieve a resource via URL and store it in a temporary location, you can do so via the "shutil.copyfileobj()" and "tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()" functions:
It is an error to extract a value using a non existent key.
This allows the exception to properly propagate up and cause the interpreter to exit
Many Python programmers never bother to use private variable names at all.

Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.
The ".pyc" file includes the timestamp and size of the source file, which Python will compare against the metadata of the source file at runtime to determine if the ".pyc" file needs to be regenerated.
So if you mistakenly write "y.sort()" thinking it will give you a sorted copy of "y", you'll instead end up with "None", which will likely cause your program to generate an easily diagnosed error.
