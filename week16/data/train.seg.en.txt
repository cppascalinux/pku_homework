These are: conversions to "complex" and "bool", "real", "imag", "+", " ", " ", "/", "abs()", "conjugate()", " ", and "! "
If the named module cannot be found, a "ModuleNotFoundError" is raised
To see why this happens, you need to know that (a) if an object implements an "__iadd__" magic method, it gets called when the "+ " augmented assignment is executed, and its return value is what gets used in the assignment statement; and (b) for lists, "__iadd__" is equivalent to calling "extend" on the list and returning the list

Details of the format are undocumented on purpose; it may change between Python versions (although it rarely does)
Default value is "'\n'".
"Enum" classes with methods
The typical programming style using condition variables uses the lock to synchronize access to some shared state; threads that are interested in a particular change of state call "wait()" repeatedly until they see the desired state, while threads that modify the state call "notify()" or "notify_all()" when they change the state in such a way that it could possibly be a desired state for one of the waiters

It's heavy reading, but is useful as a complete guide to the language itself.
If mode is omitted and a file like object is passed as file , "file.mode" is used as the default value for mode .
The list is:
The baseline overhead can be measured by invoking the program without arguments, and it might differ between Python versions.
For example, since 0.1 is not exactly 1/10, summing three values of 0.1 may not yield exactly 0.3, either:
In this case, it is the responsibility of the event loop or scheduler running the asynchronous generator to call the asynchronous generator iterator's "aclose()" method and run the resulting coroutine object, thus allowing any pending "finally" clauses to execute.

Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error
If you use the ADPCM coder to build network packets and you want your protocol to be stateless (i.e. to be able to tolerate packet loss) you should not only transmit the data but also the state
Analysis functions
Note how the order of the "for" and "if" statements is the same in both these snippets.
This allows them to be created and copied very simply
However, there may be useful functions which are conceptually related but do not depend on the data
New in version 3.5.
It is also insecure by default: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker.
Installation steps
If the option existed to be removed, return "True"; otherwise return "False".

Two exception classes that are not related via subclassing are never equivalent, even if they have the same name.
Consider a Python function "f(a, b, c)"; you may wish to create a new function "g(b, c)" that's equivalent to "f(1, b, c)"; you're filling in a value for one of "f()"'s parameters
Constructors for container types must conform to two rules:
It will be made a "TypeError" in a future version of Python
This implementation takes the object passed as extra to the constructor and adds it to kwargs using key 'extra'
Possible values are:
Don't worry too much though if you have a type you want to define, the chances are very good that you will only implement a handful of these.
If it returns "False", the subclass is not considered a subclass of this ABC, even if it would normally be one
Once a thread object is created, its activity must be started by calling the thread's "start()" method

Similarly, the second letter can be either of "' '" (which means the command writes to standard output), "'f'" (which means the command writes a file on the command line) or "'.'" (which means the command does not write anything, and hence must be last.)
Returns "0" if no combining class is defined.
This allows you to use the shell filename completion to specify the test module
If the input date has any other valid timezone offset, the "datetime" will be an aware "datetime" with the corresponding a "timezone" "tzinfo".

Here's an overview:
Event Loop Methods
This chapter describes modules which support handling data formats commonly used on the Internet.
Python 3.6.2 final
Special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e.g. "__eq__()", "__lt__()", "__add__()", "__rsub__()", etc.) to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type; may be returned by the in place binary special methods (e.g. "__imul__()", "__iand__()", etc.) for the same purpose
Parameters: fun a function with no arguments or "None"
background Specifies the cell or item background color
In these cases, the "parse_known_args()" method can be useful
Source code: Lib/netrc.py
Release date: 2018 05 30
Some options cannot be changed in this mode, such as the install directory; to modify these, you will need to remove and then reinstall Python completely.
[1] A problem with the GNU Readline package may prevent this.
An asynchronous comprehension may suspend the execution of the coroutine function in which it appears
Interactive Console Objects
In this case, asyncio would emit a log message when the Future object is garbage collected.
Changed in version 3.9: The errors parameter was added.
"email.utils": Miscellaneous utilities
However, explicitly passing "input None" to inherit the parent's standard input file handle is not supported.
Basic Examples
Note:
If sort_dicts is false (the default), dictionaries will be displayed with their keys in insertion order, otherwise the dict keys will be sorted
The optional second item is the parameter name as string
This means that Python 3.9 supports Windows Vista and newer
Tests
All other options are passed as "name value", where the value is usually "0" to disable a feature, "1" to enable a feature, or a path
Tools/Demos
Set the turtle's first coordinate to x , leave second coordinate unchanged.
author: Peter Moody
A future, optimized implementation may occasionally wake up more than n threads.
This class builds on "InteractiveInterpreter" and adds prompting using the familiar "sys.ps1" and "sys.ps2", and input buffering.
Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, "super()" is not limited to use inside methods
If an exception is being debugged, the line where the exception was originally raised or propagated is indicated by ">>", if it differs from the current line.
This is called automatically when the connection is garbage collected.
fdel is a function for deleting an attribute value
Generate a stereo fragment from a mono fragment
Cut Copy selection into the system wide clipboard; then delete the selection.
You can specify stack_info independently of exc_info , e.g. to just show how you got to a certain point in your code, even when no exceptions were raised
Is there an equivalent of C's "?:" ternary operator?
In a FIFO (first in, first out) queue, the first tasks added are the first retrieved
See also:
If timeout is given, it specifies the length of time in milliseconds which the system will wait for events before returning
API and ABI Versioning
Changed in version 3.2: Many of the following methods have been reworked and fixed, which makes them incompatible with their 3.1 counterparts.
Note that filters attached to handlers are consulted before an event is emitted by the handler, whereas filters attached to loggers are consulted whenever an event is logged (using "debug()", "info()", etc.), before sending an event to handlers
ABC hierarchy:
Changed in version 3.6: Previously, a plain "RuntimeError" was raised for unrecognized compression values.
The "Context" type
Fallback Values
If the lock is currently in a locked state, return "False"; otherwise set the lock to a locked state and return "True".
They were deprecated since Python 3.7
Core and Builtins
Here's an example that alters the "statistics.mean()" function to prevent the data parameter from being used as a keyword argument:
"zlib" Compression compatible with gzip
The arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".
Unix V7 synonym for "S_IXUSR".
String Methods Strings support a large number of methods for basic transformations and searching.
Please note that config parsers don't support escaping of comment prefixes so using inline_comment_prefixes may prevent users from specifying option values with characters used as comment prefixes
The parameters to "field()" are:
This may be "CHECK_UNKNOWN" until enough of the input has been decoded to determine what integrity check it uses.
Turtle methods
If loading fails, the loader must remove any modules it has inserted into "sys.modules", but it must remove only the failing module(s), and only if the loader itself has loaded the module(s) explicitly.
New in version 3.5: The mangle_from_ parameter.
Source code: Lib/keyword.py
Note that "a op1 b op2 c" doesn't imply any kind of comparison between a and c , so that, e.g., "x < y > z" is perfectly legal (though perhaps not pretty).
String input now results in an immediate error.
Alternatively, for trusted input, the shell's own pipeline support may still be used directly:
For example:
If the call hasn't completed in timeout seconds, then a "concurrent.futures.TimeoutError" will be raised
All defect classes are subclassed from "email.errors.MessageDefect".
Calling "getinfo()" for a name not currently contained in the archive will raise a "KeyError".
Either action or delayfunc can raise an exception
4 "abcb" Back up, so that "[bcd] " matches one less character
[ Examples ]
Raises a "LookupError" if no encoder can be found.
Return a new bytearray object from any object, o , that implements the buffer protocol.
"tzinfo" Objects
In the constructor ident can either be an int or an object with a "fileno()" method
Note:
A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements
(A third way is using the "write()" method of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as "sys.stdout"
However, where Java makes locks and condition variables basic behavior of every object, they are separate objects in Python
Note:
Note:
If errors is provided, it determines how encoding errors are handled.
You might want to override this method if you want to convert the record to a dict or JSON string, or send a modified copy of the record while leaving the original intact.
Tasks awaiting on "wait()" will now block until the "set()" method is called again.
Graphic User Interface FAQ
The second parameter, callback , can be a callable object that receives notification when ob is garbage collected; it should accept a single parameter, which will be the weak reference object itself
Logs a message with level "ERROR" on this logger
Example of how to create a compressed GZIP file:
Config parsers do not guess datatypes of values in configuration files, always storing them internally as strings
Use "issubclass()" to check class inheritance: "issubclass(bool, int)" is "True" since "bool" is a subclass of "int"
Token value used to indicate a comment.
For instance, the following function:
Since the support for negative indices and slicing occurs in the object's "__getitem__()" method, subclasses overriding this method will need to explicitly add that support.
out should be a file like object which will default to sys.stdout
result is what the foreign function returns, as specified by the "restype" attribute.
"path" should be a "str" and an absolute path.
Module attributes are writable: you can write "modname.the_answer 42"
Example:
For example, the decimal equivalent for "&gt;" is "&#62;", whereas the hexadecimal is "&#x3E;"; in this case the method will receive "'62'" or "'x3E'"
IDLE is a basic editor and interpreter environment which ships with the standard distribution of Python.
The "acquire()" and "release()" methods also call the corresponding methods of the associated lock.

It is affectionately known as "the walrus operator" due to its resemblance to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.
Added "statistics.NormalDist", a tool for creating and manipulating normal distributions of a random variable
Logging Levels
To change the file object's position, use "f.seek(offset, whence)"
In addition, for each of the "Decimal" methods described above (with the exception of the "adjusted()" and "as_tuple()" methods) there is a corresponding "Context" method
Objects of these types are hashable, meaning that they can be used as dictionary keys.
Raises an auditing event "ctypes.wstring_at" with arguments "address", "size".
Running in Threads
Changed in version 3.8: "CancelledError" is now a subclass of "BaseException".
New in version 3.3.

Note that in order to test something, we use one of the "assert ()" methods provided by the "TestCase" base class
Functions for sequences
Their interfaces are defined in the "io" module
Modes "'r+'" and "'r+b'" open the file with no truncation.
See also:
New in version 3.6.
Use of alternative formatting styles

A value of 1 indicates that this is not known, and will usually result in the correct state being filled in.
New in version 3.6.
Program Frameworks
Logs a message with integer level level on this logger
A set display yields a new mutable set object, the contents being specified by either a sequence of expressions or a comprehension
A "netrc" instance has the following methods:
Deprecated Python behavior
The arguments must have numeric types
The recommended way to create array types is by multiplying a data type with a positive integer:
Also disable these manipulations if "site" is explicitly imported later (call "site.main()" if you want them to be triggered).
After the profiler is calibrated, it will be more accurate (in a least square sense), but it will sometimes produce negative numbers (when call counts are exceptionally low, and the gods of probability work against you : )
f string String literals prefixed with "'f'" or "'F'" are commonly called "f strings" which is short for formatted string literals
For example, all classes inherit from "object", so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach "object"
This way, you can use date/timestamps from Python without any additional fiddling in most cases
That can still use % formatting, as shown here:
The colon is not part of either the field name or the field value
key is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_ constants.
It is possible to define sub subclasses of structures, they inherit the fields of the base class
Call to set a new value for the context variable in the current context.

This module provides low level primitives for working with multiple threads (also called light weight processes or tasks ) multiple threads of control sharing their global data space
[ Datagram Protocols ]
Policy Objects
This value can be retrieved and changed on runtime using the "default_section" instance attribute.
Its effect is to disable all logging calls of severity level and below, so that if you call it with a value of INFO, then all INFO and DEBUG events would be discarded, whereas those of severity WARNING and above would be processed according to the logger's effective level
Functions for bytes
Visibility ~~~~~~~~~~
The "distutils.core" module is the only module that needs to be installed to use the Distutils
When follow_symlinks is false, and src is a symbolic link, "copy2()" attempts to copy all metadata from the src symbolic link to the newly created dst symbolic link
Core and Builtins
Build
Tools/Demos
The modules described in this chapter provide a wide range of services related to the Python interpreter and its interaction with its environment
Help and preferences
The "help" strings can include various format specifiers to avoid repetition of things like the program name or the argument default
An example:
Represents the C "unsigned char" datatype, it interprets the value as small integer
If you see the following error, you do not have the launcher installed:
The "filecmp" module defines the following functions:

Many data structure needs can be met with the built in list type
Reference Counts
PyGTK, PyQt, PySide2, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more widgets than Tkinter
For such event loops, using "set_child_watcher()" might be prohibited or have no effect.
Often you'll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space separated values
Note that the whitespace is collapsed before the text is passed to the "TextWrapper" "fill()" function, so changing the value of "tabsize", "expand_tabs", "drop_whitespace", and "replace_whitespace" will have no effect.
PEP 308: Conditional Expressions
In Python 3.10, the old parser will be deleted and so will all functionality that depends on it (primarily the "parser" module, which has long been deprecated)
Changed in version 3.2: The "Fraction" constructor now accepts "float" and "decimal.Decimal" instances.
Return the number of occurrences of value in o , that is, return the number of keys for which "o[key] value"
The evaluation rules for the decorator expressions are the same as for function decorators
Invalid arguments
n is the length of the list; it is not packed into the buffer, but a "ValueError" exception is raised if "len(array)" is not equal to n
Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.
In Python 3.9 only , you can switch back to the LL(1) parser using a command line switch (" X oldparser") or an environment variable ("PYTHONOLDPARSER 1").
The count goes down whenever a consumer coroutine calls "task_done()" to indicate that the item was retrieved and all work on it is complete
PEP 278: Universal Newline Support
Otherwise, the core Python path is constructed from the PythonPath stored in the registry.
Caution: The result of a "ratio()" call may depend on the order of the arguments
"atexit" runs these functions in the reverse order in which they were registered; if you register "A", "B", and "C", at interpreter termination time they will be run in the order "C", "B", "A".
Extension modules: "m_traverse", "m_clear" and "m_free" functions of "PyModuleDef" are no longer called if the module state was requested but is not allocated yet
GTK+ comes with many more widgets than Tkinter provides
A command to check (or even suggest) matching parentheses, quotes, etc., would also be useful.

Other Improvements
Note:
Python programs written in functional style usually won't go to the extreme of avoiding all I/O or all assignments; instead, they'll provide a functional appearing interface but will use non functional features internally

Let's create an extension module called "spam" (the favorite food of Monty Python fans...) and let's say we want to create a Python interface to the C library function "system()" [1]
As stated earlier, regular expressions use the backslash character ("'\'") to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning
For integer type fields like "c_int", a third optional item can be given
"email.iterators": Iterators
The "py_compile" module can manually compile any module
Using nested scopes:
An example:
The directories are recursively traversed for Python sources.
Optimizations
If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that defines the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances they continue to use the old class definition
Token value for ""("".
Enter newline mode
True division and multiplication of a "timedelta" object by a "float" object are now supported.
(This behavior is useful when debugging: if an escape sequence is mistyped, the resulting output is more easily recognized as broken.) It is also important to note that the escape sequences only recognized in string literals fall into the category of unrecognized escapes for bytes literals.
line started by this opcode (if any), otherwise "None"
The Path Based Finder
The elements of both sequences must be hashable .
When "0 < rv < size", the output conversion was successful and rv characters were written to str (excluding the trailing "'\0'" byte at str [ rv ]).
Hashing of numeric types
Attributes and Color
The environment variable "TZ" specifies how this is done
Raised when an operation would block on an object (e.g. socket) set for non blocking operation
Undocumented Modules
"outline": positive number
If obj supports writable buffer exports, the memoryview object will be read/write, otherwise it may be either read only or read/write at the discretion of the exporter.
In addition it has a "readline()" method which returns the next input line, and a "__getitem__()" method which implements the sequence behavior
If the "try" statement reaches a "break", "continue" or "return" statement, the "finally" clause will execute just prior to the "break", "continue" or "return" statement's execution.
If you are a library developer who has performance critical threads in their code, be sure to document this (together with a suggestion to attach only "QueueHandlers" to your loggers) for the benefit of other developers who will use your code.
System which created ZIP archive.
Changed in version 3.5: Added "AWAIT" and "ASYNC" tokens.

New Features
In Boolean contexts, a "time" object is always considered to be true.
This class is designed to have a similar API to the "subprocess.Popen" class, but there are some notable differences:
To simplify access to the various codec components, the module provides these additional functions which use "lookup()" for the codec lookup:
Note:
"'backslashreplace'" causes malformed data to be replaced by a backslashed escape sequence
"RLock" supports the context manager protocol and thus may be used in "with" statements.
For example, a type checker might flag the following code as an error:
Changed in version 3.4: Updated to be based on PEP 451
Annotated assignment statements
More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built in names
A module's __name__ is set equal to "'__main__'" when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.
Availability: Windows.
With context set and decimals created, the bulk of the program manipulates the data no differently than with other Python numeric types.
No XENIX semaphores available
Deprecated functions and variables
Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built in module) from which it is loaded
Command line
This member is either "None" or a dictionary containing Python objects that need to be kept alive so that the memory block contents is kept valid
Fixes the API change in generator's "throw()" method.
Keyed hashing
type must be a pointer type, and obj must be an object that can be interpreted as a pointer.
For example:
Conditional expressions
"pwd" is the "pwd" parameter to "ZipFile.open()".
Cleanup
Importing From a Package
To avoid memory corruption, extension writers should never try to operate on Python objects with the functions exported by the C library: "malloc()", "calloc()", "realloc()" and "free()"
(Contributed by Paul Ganssle in bpo 36004.)
Use and behaviors of the timeout argument are the same as in "Lock.acquire()"
The iteration ends when the sequence raises "IndexError" for the subscripting operation.

This is normally the base filename, e.g. 'test.log'.
This CRC is used in the binhex4 format.
The variables "sys.ps1" and "sys.ps2" define the strings used as primary and secondary prompts:
Security
Only the "truncate()" method isn't implemented.
Release date: 2016 06 13
This concept is more relevant to a command like cp , whose most basic usage is "cp SRC DEST"
A "TypeError" exception is raised if you try to compare objects of different versions or different types.
"sunau" Read and write Sun AU files
Source code: Lib/email/iterators.py
The primary intended purpose of executable lines is to make the corresponding module(s) importable (load 3rd party import hooks, adjust "PATH" etc)
Since hook functions may be called from different runtimes, this pointer should not refer directly to Python state.
"ClassVar" accepts only types and cannot be further subscribed.
Argument abbreviations (prefix matching)
Address objects
If w is provided, it specifies the width of the date columns, which are centered
Likewise, when the "Overflow" signal is not trapped, infinity can result from rounding beyond the limits of the largest representable number.
If only globals is provided, it must be a dictionary (and not a subclass of dictionary), which will be used for both the global and the local variables
File Operations
Specifically, the example specifies meta information to build packages, and it specifies the contents of the package
"ast" classes "Num", "Str", "Bytes", "NameConstant" and "Ellipsis" are considered deprecated and will be removed in future Python versions
Deprecated since version 3.9: "collections.abc.ItemsView" now supports "[]"

A human readable string of the verification error.
XMLParser Objects
What's New in Python 2.1
When you have a literal value for a list, tuple, or dictionary spread across multiple lines, it's easier to add more elements because you don't have to remember to add a comma to the previous line
Create a new dictionary
It is also possible to use a "str" or bytes like object as a file for both reading and writing
Deprecated functions and types of the C API
This is because lock implementations in the "threading" module are not always re entrant, and so cannot be invoked from such signal handlers.
"0" is Monday (the default), "6" is Sunday.
If no such value is defined, default is returned, or, if not given, "ValueError" is raised.
Output Formatting
Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we'll begin with the most common task: matching characters.
Types and members
Changed in version 3.3: When one of the worker processes terminates abruptly, a "BrokenProcessPool" error is now raised
Cancel the drag and drop process.

New in version 3.5: "follow_wrapped" parameter
There's still more left in the RE, though, and the ">" can't match at the end of the string, so the regular expression engine has to backtrack character by character until it finds a match for the ">"
Return "True" if the file descriptors fp1 and fp2 refer to the same file.
Note that parser level defaults always override argument level defaults:
The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list
This document is a gentle introduction to the topic.
[3] The Unicode standard distinguishes between code points (e.g. U+0041) and abstract characters (e.g. "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A")

New in version 3.4.
As we can easily check, our array is sorted now:
This means that "ProcessPoolExecutor" will not work in the interactive interpreter.
With a list comprehension, you get back a Python list; "stripped_list" is a list containing the resulting lines, not an iterator
But "strptime()" is independent of any platform and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not documented as supported.

Bytes read from the original file are decoded according to file_encoding , and the result is encoded using data_encoding .
The simplest text encoding (called "'latin 1'" or "'iso 8859 1'") maps the code points 0 255 to the bytes "0x0" "0xff", which means that a string object that contains code points above "U+00FF" can't be encoded with this codec

New syntax features:
However, in Fortran contiguous arrays, the first index varies the fastest.
In this case, the elements of the new container are those that would be produced by considering each of the "for" or "if" clauses a block, nesting from left to right, and evaluating the expression to produce an element each time the innermost block is reached.
timeout can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning

For example:
Because the fields are in insertion order, derived classes override base classes

Another example that uses the ignore argument to add a logging call:
Updated module: unittest
Note:
Path entries need not be limited to file system locations
Multiple calls to "getLogger()" with the same name will always return a reference to the same Logger object.
There are differences, outlined later, but the behavior is very close to what you would expect from a dictionary.
Check both databases to get complete membership information
A simple example
By re using a seed value, the same sequence should be reproducible from run to run as long as multiple threads are not running.

Note:
The size can also be gotten by calling "PySequence_Size()" on o , but "PySequence_Fast_GET_SIZE()" is faster because it can assume o is a list or tuple.
If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits are performed.
It is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it; however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.
Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes are received or sent
Also, the current "contextvars.Context" is propogated, allowing context variables from the event loop thread to be accessed in the separate thread.

If any keyword argument does not correspond to a formal parameter name, a "TypeError" exception is raised, unless a formal parameter using the syntax " identifier" is present; in this case, that formal parameter receives a dictionary containing the excess keyword arguments (using the keywords as keys and the argument values as corresponding values), or a (new) empty dictionary if there were no excess keyword arguments.
The counter can never go below zero; when "acquire()" finds that it is zero, it blocks, waiting until some other thread calls "release()".
A strange thing happens if you just print a range:

Before Python 3.3, they used to raise "IOError", now an alias of "OSError".
This conversion is carried out in the application; if possible invisible to the user: The application should transparently convert Unicode domain labels to IDNA on the wire, and convert back ACE labels to Unicode before presenting them to the user.
To avoid interfering with the expected operation of the generator expression itself, "yield" and "yield from" expressions are prohibited in the implicitly defined generator.
The callable will receive the path of the archive, followed by the directory the archive must be extracted to.
Note that this download may be bigger than required, but where a large number of installations are going to be performed it is very useful to have a locally cached copy.
When the result becomes ready callback is applied to it, that is unless the call failed, in which case the error_callback is applied instead.

"ipaddress" tries to make doing this easy and intuitive.
This is because integers are immutable , and when we do "x x + 1" we are not mutating the int "5" by incrementing its value; instead, we are creating a new object (the int "6") and assigning it to "x" (that is, changing which object "x" refers to)

Outside of loops, there's not much difference thanks to the internal cache.
When func is a descriptor (such as a normal Python function, "classmethod()", "staticmethod()", "abstractmethod()" or another instance of "partialmethod"), calls to "__get__" are delegated to the underlying descriptor, and an appropriate partial object returned as the result.
On the next call to the generator's "__next__()" method, the function will resume executing.

This method will wait (using the "delayfunc()" function passed to the constructor) for the next event, then execute it and so on until there are no more scheduled events.
The most important difference between these two functions is that "import_module()" returns the specified package or module (e.g. "pkg.mod"), while "__import__()" returns the top level package or module (e.g. "pkg").
If endptr is not "NULL", convert as much of the string as possible and set " endptr" to point to the first unconverted character
If callback is provided and not "None", and the returned weakref object is still alive, the callback will be called when the object is about to be finalized; the weak reference object will be passed as the only parameter to the callback; the referent will no longer be available.

So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.
Raises an auditing event "shutil.copytree" with arguments "src", "dst".
This ensures that in addition to being seen by both the interpreter itself and other locale aware components running in the same process (such as the GNU "readline" library), the updated setting is also seen in subprocesses (regardless of whether or not those processes are running a Python interpreter), as well as in operations that query the environment rather than the current C locale (such as Python's own "locale.getdefaultlocale()").
Detect writes before the start of a buffer (buffer underflows)
New in version 3.2.

Then you need to give your class a method "__conform__(self, protocol)" which must return the converted value
For example, someone could pass "__import__('os').system("rm rf $HOME")" which would erase your home directory.
"email.iterators": Iterators
This is of limited utility, since the only way for such a message to be valid is for it to contain only ASCII text or, if "utf8" is "True", no binary attachments.

The name argument specifies what module to import in absolute or relative terms (e.g. either "pkg.mod" or "..mod")
Note:
In addition, asyncio's Subprocess APIs provide a way to start a process and communicate with it from the event loop
The semantics of non essential built in object types and of the built in functions and modules are described in The Python Standard Library

There are two modes of operation:
Power and logarithmic functions
Returns the file system path to the resource .
By definition, immutable objects such as numbers, strings, tuples, and "None", are safe from change

"json" JSON encoder and decoder
The RFC permits, but does not require, JSON deserializers to ignore an initial BOM in their input
There is no noticeable overhead when handling a big number of children ( O(1) each time a child terminates), but stating a thread per process requires extra memory.
In the example a new tuple was created to serve as the argument list, which is "Py_DECREF()" ed immediately after the "PyObject_CallObject()" call.
The "global" statement is a declaration which holds for the entire current code block
Raise a "MemoryError" if there is no room to grow
This variable can be modified; doing so affects future searches for modules and subpackages contained in the package.
Functions in these libraries use the standard C calling convention, and are assumed to return "int".

If the header does not have a "filename" parameter, this method falls back to looking for the "name" parameter on the Content Type header
Exception raised on compression and decompression errors.
Scheduling From Other Threads
Any other offset value produces undefined behaviour.
Why is join() a string method instead of a list or tuple method?
Same as "compilest(st, filename)".
When in non blocking mode, a "BlockingIOError" is raised if the buffer needs to be written out but the raw stream blocks.
When the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance object and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list.

The "nuget.exe" command line tool may be downloaded directly from "https://aka.ms/nugetclidl", for example, using curl or PowerShell
Objects created via this constructor will also bypass the cache of a deserializing process when unpickled.
Python 2.7 is currently expected to remain supported by the core development team (receiving security updates and other bug fixes) until at least 2020 (10 years after its initial release, compared to the more typical support period of 18 24 months).
Note that PyMODINIT_FUNC declares the function as "PyObject " return type, declares any special linkage declarations required by the platform, and for C++ declares the function as "extern "C"".
This code was contributed by Lance Ellinghouse, and modified by Jack Jansen.
Top level components
This module provides a class, an instance, and a function:
This is necessary to ensure that local modifications to the buffers are actually available to the mapping.
When a C function is called from Python, it borrows references to its arguments from the caller
Example
Command line options
Sequence of bytecodes that have an absolute jump target.
Set Breakpoint Set a breakpoint on the current line.
This would be useful if you want to generate values dynamically (whereas the values in a dict would be constant).
Decimal and Fraction values are supported:
With namespace packages, there is no "parent/__init__.py" file
New syntax features:
Tests
Represents the C "signed char" datatype, and interprets the value as small integer
"traceback" Print or retrieve a stack traceback
If the "INSERT" or "REPLACE" statement failed to insert the previous successful rowid is returned.

charjunk : A function that accepts a character (a string of length 1), and returns if the character is junk, or false if not
Why is there no goto?
New in version 3.9.
Here's an example RE from the "imaplib" module:
A simpler form of parameter retrieval which does not use a format string to specify the types of the arguments
This can be used to efficiently compute the digests of strings that share a common initial substring.
If "str()" is called on an instance of this class, the representation of the argument(s) to the instance are returned, or the empty string when there were no arguments.
If the asynchronous generator function then exits gracefully, is already closed, or raises "GeneratorExit" (by not catching the exception), then the returned awaitable will raise a "StopIteration" exception
New in version 3.8: "ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT" can now be passed in flags to enable support for top level "await", "async for", and "async with".
Reference
The default is "FORMAT_AUTO", which can decompress both ".xz" and ".lzma" files
Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined:
Passing "SERVER_AUTH" as purpose sets "verify_mode" to "CERT_REQUIRED" and either loads CA certificates (when at least one of cafile , capath or cadata is given) or uses "SSLContext.load_default_certs()" to load default CA certificates.
See also "Task.cancel()".
New Modules
For example:
This TurtleScreen method is available as a global function only under the name "resetscreen"
Return the default content type

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback based code to be used with async/await.
CPython implementation detail: An implementation may provide built in functions whose positional parameters do not have names, even if they are 'named' for the purpose of documentation, and which therefore cannot be supplied by keyword
Useful for detecting manual screen resize.
What's New in Python 2.5
Convert a single line of uuencoded data back to binary and return the binary data
To avoid the risk of this happening, use the "verify" argument to "listen()" to prevent unrecognised configurations from being applied.

This instance of "PyTypeObject" represents the Python dictionary type
will continue to work with the old version of the imported objects
Changed in version 3.4: In Python versions earlier than 3.4, this function could also be passed a text level, and would return the corresponding numeric value of the level
It can be replaced (by importing the "builtins" module and assigning to "builtins.__import__") in order to change semantics of the "import" statement, but doing so is strongly discouraged as it is usually simpler to use import hooks (see PEP 302 ) to attain the same goals and does not cause issues with code which assumes the default import implementation is in use
To get error reporting use "PyDict_GetItemWithError()" instead.
Subclass of "InterpolationError".
When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of "io.BufferedIOBase"

Instance Objects
Changes in the Python API
In versions of Python prior to 2.7.1 and 3.2, if this function is called from multiple threads, it is possible (in rare circumstances) that a handler will be added to the root logger more than once, leading to unexpected results such as messages being duplicated in the log.
Version interface for Jython.
In that case, it may not even be possible to import all of the modules at the top of the file
The same approach works for all method definitions.
As for addresses, a factory function is provided that determines the correct IP version automatically:
Render the Dialog window.
For example:
What happened? Here are the steps of the "rc.a, rc.b rc.b, rc.a" line above:
Here is a simple example of such a context manager, which allows you to optionally change the logging level and add a logging handler purely in the scope of the context manager:
Python 3.6.3 final
IDLE on macOS
The "operator" module exports a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python
Unfortunately, removing this first error induces a second source of error.
This facility is an enormous step forward compared to earlier versions of the interpreter; however, some wishes are left: It would be nice if the proper indentation were suggested on continuation lines (the parser knows if an indent token is required next)
New Syntax
Changed Syntax
A string literal with "'f'" or "'F'" in its prefix is a formatted string literal ; see Formatted string literals
So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat values in each combination.
This uses the following style of definition:
New in version 3.5.
Return a randomly chosen element from a non empty sequence.
To support use cases where it is useful to have access to this additional detail, the individual class constructors actually raise the "ValueError" subclasses "ipaddress.AddressValueError" and "ipaddress.NetmaskValueError" to indicate exactly which part of the definition failed to parse correctly.
Any other offset value produces undefined behaviour.
The callable will receive the base_name of the file to create, followed by the base_dir (which defaults to "os.curdir") to start archiving from
When the timeout argument is present and not "None", it should be a floating point number specifying a timeout for the operation in seconds (or fractions thereof).
Windows Constants
It is believed that overcoming this performance issue would make the implementation much more complicated and therefore costlier to maintain.
The other arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".
Rewriting
"Py_UNICODE_strcpy", "Py_UNICODE_strncpy", "Py_UNICODE_COPY": use "PyUnicode_CopyCharacters()" or "PyUnicode_Substring()"
Introduction
If there is no such parameter or it doesn't apply to the useragent specified or the "robots.txt" entry for this parameter has invalid syntax, return "None".
The RFC prohibits adding a byte order mark (BOM) to the start of a JSON text, and this module's serializer does not add a BOM to its output
Only move imports into a local scope, such as inside a function definition, if it's necessary to solve a problem such as avoiding a circular import or are trying to reduce the initialization time of a module
If it is not given, the cursor's arraysize determines the number of rows to be fetched

When an asynchronous generator function is resumed with an "__anext__()" method, the current yield expression always evaluates to "None" in the returned awaitable, which when run will continue to the next yield expression
Append the record to the buffer
"os.fsdecode()" and "os.fsencode()" use the UTF 8 encoding.

Extension module authors should exercise caution when initializing internal data structures.
The Python Standard Library
The user should subclass "HTMLParser" and override its methods to implement the desired behavior.
In memory streams
Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its incremental decoder class or factory function.
By default, Structure and Union fields are aligned in the same way the C compiler does it
If you fail to meet these restrictions dictionaries and other hash based structures will misbehave.
If the "readline" module is to be used with a custom completer, a different set of word delimiters should be set.
Usually you use the transformer like this:
"copy" Shallow and deep copy operations
So, let's tell "argparse" to treat that input as an integer:
For backwards compatibility, they continue to be visible in this module through Python 3.9.
then you would still specify the root package, but you have to tell the Distutils where source files in the root package live:
Fancier Output Formatting
The module's spec is exposed as the "__spec__" attribute on a module object
New in version 3.3.
"time" Objects
Note that ".pth" files (without leading underscore) will be processed normally by the "site" module when "import site" has been specified.
This is the equivalent of the Python statement "o1 << o2".
When the code block executes a "return" statement, this specifies the return value of the function call.
If dklen is "None" then the digest size of the hash algorithm hash_name is used, e.g. 64 for SHA 512.
Tools/Demos
"fileinput" Iterate over lines from multiple input streams
Lambdas
The "tkinter.colorchooser" module provides the "Chooser" class as an interface to the native color picker dialog
Changed in version 3.6: Added the newline parameter.

password_mgr , if given, should be something that is compatible with "HTTPPasswordMgr"; refer to section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be supported
The above example accepts arbitrary integer values for " verbosity", but for our simple program, only two values are actually useful, "True" or "False"
The result is cached, so repeated attribute accesses return the same library each time.
You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.
Python applications will often use packages and modules that don't come as part of the standard library
Compare two operands using their abstract representation rather than their value as in "compare_total()", but ignoring the sign of each operand
So now you'll ask the "py" command to give your script to Python by typing "py" followed by your script path:
Note:
Usage of "KabulTz" from above:
Changed in version 3.4: The method now supports hostname check with "ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname" and Server Name Indication (see "ssl.HAS_SNI").
An assignment expression (sometimes also called a "named expression" or "walrus") assigns an "expression" to an "identifier", while also returning the value of the "expression".
Type specific methods which need to recursively format a value should call "self.repr1(subobj, level 1)".
A "TarInfo" object also provides some convenient query methods:
Works by losslessly converting all inputs (except n ) to str, and calling "dfunc(a, b, fromfile, tofile, fromfiledate, tofiledate, n, lineterm)"
When "runcall()" returns, it returns whatever the function call returned
(See bpo 10518.)
If "sys.path_hooks" iteration ends with no path entry finder being returned, then the path based finder's "find_spec()" method will store "None" in "sys.path_importer_cache" (to indicate that there is no finder for this path entry) and return "None", indicating that this meta path finder could not find the module.
The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so "a.insert(0, x)" inserts at the front of the list, and "a.insert(len(a), x)" is equivalent to "a.append(x)".
Also input in "'exec'" mode does not have to end in a newline anymore
Sets the result of the work associated with the "Future" to result .
Enum members also have a property that contains just their item name:
The PKZIP Application Note contains some comments on the internal structure of the data contained in this "bytes" object.
Supported "__dunder__" names
This is the output of running the example above in verbose mode:

The interesting property of a heap is that "a[0]" is always its smallest element.
Changed in version 3.6: The flushOnClose parameter was added.
This meant that paths longer than this would not resolve and errors would result.

The returned function prototype creates functions that use the standard C calling convention
Set the memory block allocator of the specified domain.
The buffer's size in bytes must equal "size".

Literal strings are enclosed in quotes
For example:
Output:
It defaults to displaying the contents of the current directory.
The "copyreg" module offers a way to define functions used while pickling specific objects
Deprecated since version 3.4: The "imp" module is deprecated in favor of "importlib".
All of the generated methods will use this combined, calculated ordered mapping of fields
Put an item into the queue
The statements executed by the top level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of a module called "__main__", so they have their own global namespace
They allow you to include unescaped single and double quotes within a string and they can span multiple lines without the use of the continuation character, making them especially useful when writing docstrings.
For example, the number 1 is always before 2, 3, 4, or 5 in the examples above
Module Level Functions
This allows "OrderedDict" objects to be substituted anywhere a regular dictionary is used.
The usual approach to working with decimals is to create "Decimal" instances and then apply arithmetic operations which take place within the current context for the active thread
the module docstring (if any),
How do I...?
If, on the other hand, logging messages are only output once every five minutes (say), then there will be gaps in the file times corresponding to the minutes where no output (and hence no rollover) occurred.
PEP 528 and PEP 529, Windows filesystem and console encoding changed to UTF 8.
Signals when non zero digits were discarded during rounding
Calibration
errors may be "NULL" to use the default method defined for the codec
At the end of the file, a DEDENT token is generated for each number remaining on the stack that is larger than zero.
The "Fraction" class inherits from the abstract base class "numbers.Rational", and implements all of the methods and operations from that class
Performing "list(d)" on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use "sorted(d)" instead)
The object that this function returns will be returned from the foreign function call, but it can also check the result value and raise an exception if the foreign function call failed.
On success, "PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords()" returns true, otherwise it returns false and raises an appropriate exception.

Parse a string representing a time according to a format
[1] "%zi" Py_ssize_t Equivalent to "printf("%zi")"
The three methods that return the ratio of matching to total characters can give different results due to differing levels of approximation, although "quick_ratio()" and "real_quick_ratio()" are always at least as large as "ratio()":

Help and preferences
[1] When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is created for that call.
This may be subtle if there are two different extensions of the real numbers
Describing a logging configuration requires listing the various objects to create and the connections between them; for example, you may create a handler named 'console' and then say that the logger named 'startup' will send its messages to the 'console' handler
If a module imports objects from another module using "from" ... "import" ..., calling "reload()" for the other module does not redefine the objects imported from it one way around this is to re execute the "from" statement, another is to use "import" and qualified names ( module.name ) instead.
Deprecated Python Behavior
The child process is not killed if the timeout expires, so in order to cleanup properly a well behaved application should kill the child process and finish communication:

Unpacks a double precision floating point number, similarly to "unpack_float()".
The mantissa comes from a uniform distribution of integers in the range 2⁵² ≤ mantissa < 2⁵³
This data should be concatenated to the output produced by any preceding calls to the "compress()" method
Grouping
Some systems, including notably Windows systems, do not have an IANA database available, and so for projects targeting cross platform compatibility that require time zone data, it is recommended to declare a dependency on tzdata
Miscellaneous
As a consequence, extension modules need to be recompiled for every Python release (although an exception is possible on Unix when none of the affected interfaces are used)

Build
Changed in version 3.3: "WindowsError" used to be raised.
The intent is that the "tzinfo" methods interpret dt as being in local time, and not need worry about objects in other timezones.
Normally, when you pass an invalid argument list to the "parse_args()" method of an "ArgumentParser", it will exit with error info.
The key "'()'" has been used as the special key because it is not a valid keyword parameter name, and so will not clash with the names of the keyword arguments used in the call
Load a snapshot from a file.
At runtime, an arbitrary value is allowed as type argument to "Literal[...]", but type checkers may impose restrictions
"logging.handlers" Logging handlers
How can I pass optional or keyword parameters from one function to another?
The function is called with anything (which should be compatible with "void ") as its argument and should return a "new" Python object, or "NULL" if an error occurred.
Insert val into the dictionary p with a key of key
If filename is omitted, it will check all the entries in the cache.
In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace
In addition, the module provides three pre made contexts:
Because arg_name is not quote delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings "'10'" or "': ]'") within a format string
See the Wikipedia page on the half precision floating point format for more information.

Changed in version 3.8: On Windows, path can now be a file or directory.
Otherwise, they are evaluated when the function definition is executed
Text file busy
Future calls to the "poll()" method will then check whether the file descriptor has any pending I/O events
If the globals dictionary is present and does not contain a value for the key "__builtins__", a reference to the dictionary of the built in module "builtins" is inserted under that key before expression is parsed
bdist_wininst is deprecated since Python 3.8.

Accessing columns by name instead of by index
Now that we've looked at some simple regular expressions, how do we actually use them in Python? The "re" module provides an interface to the regular expression engine, allowing you to compile REs into objects and then perform matches with them.
In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the "enumerate()" function, see Looping Techniques.
Create a shallow copy of the current thread context
New in version 3.2.
Changing the object graph arbitrarily in a safe way is problematic in a multi threaded environment; while not impossible, the benefits are not worth the complexity it adds to the implementation.
The modern interface provides:
If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call to "emit()"
Exchanging objects between processes
Flags are sticky, so the user needs to reset them before monitoring a calculation.
If the Future's result isn't yet available, this method raises a "InvalidStateError" exception.
Set the number of channels.
See bpo 13936 for full details.
Using "datetime.strptime(date_string, format)" is equivalent to:
Reads and returns at most n frames of audio, as a "bytes" object.
Pushes "__aexit__" and result of "__aenter__()" to the stack.
The optional argument defaults to " 1", so that by default the last item is removed and returned.

Private functions: "_PyObject_GC_TRACK()", "_PyObject_GC_UNTRACK()", "_Py_Dealloc()"
Decimal floating point objects share many properties with the other built in numeric types such as "float" and "int"
Since creating a message object structure from a string or a file object is such a common task, four functions are provided as a convenience
Outputs the number in base 16, using upper case letters for the digits above 9
Omitting values
The output will be the same as before, but the log file is no longer appended to, so the messages from earlier runs are lost.
Corresponds to "errno" "EACCES" and "EPERM".
If the object is a type or class object, the list contains the names of its attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its bases.
Third party code could play tricks with this to provide a dynamically created collection of frozen modules.
This minor API extension makes it possible to write "numerator, denominator x.as_integer_ratio()" and have it work across multiple numeric types

Changed in version 3.5: The default ssl_version is changed from "PROTOCOL_SSLv3" to "PROTOCOL_TLS" for maximum compatibility with modern servers.
The name of our type
Strings have several methods for performing operations with fixed strings and they're usually much faster, because the implementation is a single small C loop that's been optimized for the purpose, instead of the large, more generalized regular expression engine.
Array elements can be read and written using standard subscript and slice accesses; for slice reads, the resulting object is not itself an "Array".
PEP 389: Argparse Command Line Parsing Module
Release date: 2016 12 23
Functions such as "expanduser()" and "expandvars()" can be invoked explicitly when an application desires shell like path expansion
format_code must be one of "'e'", "'E'", "'f'", "'F'", "'g'", "'G'" or "'r'"
They are, however, slower than using shared memory.

"wave" Read and write WAV files
It ignores zero and negative counts.
Round to nearest with ties going to nearest even integer.
This module provides classes and functions for comparing sequences
For readability and performance, it makes sense to restrict the way arguments can be passed so that a developer need only look at the function definition to determine if items are passed by position, by position or keyword, or by keyword.
If "signal.SIGINT" isn't handled by Python (it was set to "signal.SIG_DFL" or "signal.SIG_IGN"), this function does nothing.
The "weakref" module provides tools for tracking objects without creating a reference
Deprecated features

In normal conditions, the main thread is the thread from which the Python interpreter was started.
Unpacked fields can be named by assigning them to variables or by wrapping the result in a named tuple:
It contains a set of functions corresponding to Python's operators
This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by "sys.stdin.fileno()", or a file object , such as "sys.stdin" itself.

The files named in args (or on the command line, if args is "None") are compiled and the resulting byte code is cached in the normal manner
This method returns "True" if and only if the internal flag has been set to true, either before the wait call or after the wait starts, so it will always return "True" except if a timeout is given and the operation times out.

It uses Format Strings as compact descriptions of the layout of the C structs and the intended conversion to/from Python values.
To create one's own manager, one creates a subclass of "BaseManager" and uses the "register()" classmethod to register new types or callables with the manager class
For example, the "append()" method is expected to add new elements to the end of some internal list; an interface specification cannot test that your "append()" implementation will actually do this correctly, but it's trivial to check this property in a test suite.
Constant Description "FIRST_COMPLETED" The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled
(To summarize, the key type should be hashable , which excludes all mutable objects.) Clashes between duplicate keys are not detected; the last datum (textually rightmost in the display) stored for a given key value prevails.

Deprecated since version 3.9: "collections.ChainMap" now supports "[]"
On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.
The handler's level is set to "WARNING", so all events at this and greater severities will be output.
Note that using a module is also the basis for implementing the Singleton design pattern, for the same reason.
What's New In Python 3.4
Therefore it does not support bytes to bytes encoders such as "base64_codec".
Explicitly via the column name
If the message preparer is able to find cryptographic hash function collisions (i.e., two messages producing the same hash value), then they might prepare meaningful versions of the message that would produce the same hash value and digital signature, but with different results (e.g., transferring $1,000,000 to an account, rather than $10)

This manual documents the API used by C and C++ programmers who want to write extension modules or embed Python
Building Arbitrary Values
Parameters: fun a function with no arguments
Changed in version 3.7: The defaults argument is read with "read_dict()", providing consistent behavior across the parser: non string keys and values are implicitly converted to strings.
A solitary difference from its close analog exists: its "acquire" method's first argument is named block , as is consistent with "Lock.acquire()".
Remove func from the list of functions to be run at interpreter shutdown
When reading input from the stream, if newline is "None", universal newlines mode is enabled
Build
The options to the "enable()" function control whether the report is displayed in the browser and whether the report is logged to a file for later analysis.
Some examples of formatted string literals:

If a part has a Content Disposition header, only consider the part a candidate match if the value of the header is "inline".
The tuple will always grow or shrink at the end
Objects
"ClassVar" is not a class itself, and should not be used with "isinstance()" or "issubclass()"
Return a callable object that fetches attr from its operand
It is impossible to know in advance which attribute will be referenced at runtime
See also PEP 530 .
For example, "a < b c" tests whether "a" is less than "b" and moreover "b" equals "c".
To run your script from the Terminal window you must make sure that "/usr/local/bin" is in your shell search path.

Roughly equivalent to:
PEP 3101: Advanced String Formatting
Dedent Region Shift selected lines left by the indent width (default 4 spaces).
PEP 526 Syntax for Variable Annotations Ability to type hint variable declarations, including class variables and instance variables
I recommend that you always put parentheses around a "yield" expression when you're doing something with the returned value, as in the above example
The typical usage to inspect a crashed program is:
Attribute Index Value Value if not present "scheme" 0 URL scheme specifier scheme parameter "netloc" 1 Network location part empty string "path" 2 Hierarchical path empty string "params" 3 Parameters for last path empty string element "query" 4 Query component empty string "fragment" 5 Fragment identifier empty string "username" User name "None" "password" Password "None" "hostname" Host name (lower case) "None" "port" Port number as integer, if "None" present
In order to be compatible with test discovery, all of the test files must be modules or packages (including namespace packages ) importable from the top level directory of the project (this means that their filenames must be valid identifiers).
Merge them into an iterator of tuples, sort the resulting list, and then pick out the element you want.
Note: The code samples in this tutorial use "doctest" to make sure that they actually work
Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its "__next__()" method
Module objects have a secret read only attribute called "__dict__" which returns the dictionary used to implement the module's namespace; the name "__dict__" is an attribute but not a global name
If the path cannot be handled, "OSError" is raised.
Yes
It is called with the actual object used in a foreign function call when the type is present in the foreign function's "argtypes" tuple; it must return an object that can be used as a function call parameter.

It is the only triple with "n 0"
The expression "t2 t3" will always be equal to the expression "t2 + ( t3)" except when t3 is equal to "timedelta.max"; in that case the former will produce a result while the latter will overflow.
Yes.
Automatic restarting preserves pdb's state (such as breakpoints) and in most cases is more useful than quitting the debugger upon program's exit.
If no blocks match, this returns "(alo, blo, 0)".

When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated.
Creates a tuple consuming count items from the stack, and pushes the resulting tuple onto the stack.
On Unix this is done using the "SIGTERM" signal; on Windows "TerminateProcess()" is used
If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function's body, it's assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.

"Py_UNICODE_strchr", "Py_UNICODE_strrchr": use "PyUnicode_FindChar()"
title title for the sub parser group in help output; by default "subcommands" if description is provided, otherwise uses title for positional arguments
So when converting to 8 bit wide samples for these formats, you need to also add 128 to the result:
In this case, you will have to clear the cached value after a formatter has done its formatting, so that the next formatter to handle the event doesn't use the cached value but recalculates it afresh.
Deprecated since version 3.6: Since Python 3.6 the support of non integer arguments like floats or strings in "getgrgid()" is deprecated.
Its constructor needs a Canvas, ScrolledCanvas or TurtleScreen as argument, so the RawTurtle objects know where to draw.
Return the approximate size of the queue

The simplest way to use urllib.request is as follows:
If there are no such named headers in the message, failobj is returned (defaults to "None").
"builtins" Built in objects
Build and C API Changes
The python command and most stdlib scripts (as well as "argparse") now output " version" information to "stdout" instead of "stderr" (for issue list see Other Improvements above).
See also method "timetz()".
Since "datetime" supports wider range of values than "mktime()" on many platforms, this method may raise "OverflowError" for times far in the past or far in the future.
Display the value of the expression if it changed, each time execution stops in the current frame.
Note that descendant processes of the process will not be terminated they will simply become orphaned.
Change owner user and/or group of the given path .
"'w:gz'" Open for gzip compressed writing
input and output must be file objects
The standard implementation of Python, CPython , uses reference counting to detect inaccessible objects, and another mechanism to collect reference cycles, periodically executing a cycle detection algorithm which looks for inaccessible cycles and deletes the objects involved
A few of the more complicated operations only take 16 bit samples, otherwise the sample size (in bytes) is always a parameter of the operation.
If ignore_errors is true, errors resulting from failed removals will be ignored; if false or omitted, such errors are handled by calling a handler specified by onerror or, if that is omitted, they raise an exception.
If possible, descriptors for imported base classes are included

Adds "._pth" file support and removes "applocal" option from "pyvenv.cfg".
In short, to match a literal backslash, one has to write "'\\\\'" as the RE string, because the regular expression must be "\\", and each backslash must be expressed as "\\" inside a regular Python string literal
"functools.reduce()" takes the first two elements A and B returned by the iterator and calculates "func(A, B)"
Change the stream position to the given byte offset
Specifically, if the process calling "listen()" runs on a multi user machine where users cannot trust each other, then a malicious user could arrange to run essentially arbitrary code in a victim user's process, simply by connecting to the victim's "listen()" socket and sending a configuration which runs whatever code the attacker wants to have executed in the victim's process
Changed in version 3.3: Support was added for filename being a file object instead of an actual filename.
The "email" package provides some convenient encoders in its "encoders" module
More drawing control ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The method for computing quantiles can be varied depending on whether the data includes or excludes the lowest and highest possible values from the population.
This example introduces several new features.
The runtime may have already been installed on a user's system previously or automatically via Windows Update, and can be detected by finding "ucrtbase.dll" in the system directory.
The exact type can be determined by checking the "exact_type" property on the named tuple returned from "tokenize.tokenize()".
If the environment variable "PYTHONHOME" is set, it is assumed as "Python Home"

A long running calculation implemented purely in C (such as regular expression matching on a large body of text) may run uninterrupted for an arbitrary amount of time, regardless of any signals received
In dry run mode, pairs should still be added to represent what would have been created.
Special requirement for pickling: A "tzinfo" subclass must have an "__init__()" method that can be called with no arguments, otherwise it can be pickled but possibly not unpickled again
Execute end of drag and drop functions.
[1] Note that the sign of the timezone offset is the opposite of the sign of the "time.timezone" variable for the same timezone; the latter variable follows the POSIX standard while this module follows RFC 2822 .
Thus, if an attribute is not found in "DerivedClassName", it is searched for in "Base1", then (recursively) in the base classes of "Base1", and if it was not found there, it was searched for in "Base2", and so on.

On large file capable Linux systems, this might work:
This is different from the default, in which the item is produced by itself.
All other keystrokes are treated as a command to insert the given character and move right (with line wrapping).
Return "a b"
Changed in version 3.6: Errors from finalization no longer ignored.
Note:
Changed in version 3.2: The file object really is a binary file; previously it was incorrectly returned in text mode
This method has to be called to ensure that underlying resources are cleaned up.
Options you shouldn't use
Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other string, so """ in "abc"" will return "True".
For example, "product(A, B)" returns the same as "((x,y) for x in A for y in B)".
This is useful for making columns line up.
If available, the "spwd" module should be used where access to the encrypted password is required.
Examples
When the function returns, the thread silently exits.
"Py_UNICODE_strncmp": use "PyUnicode_Tailmatch()"
"HTMLParser" Methods
As a rule of thumb, a "ratio()" value over 0.6 means the sequences are close matches:
You can check if an object is an instance of any of a number of classes by providing a tuple instead of a single class, e.g. "isinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...))", and can also check whether an object is one of Python's built in types, e.g. "isinstance(obj, str)" or "isinstance(obj, (int, float, complex))".

It is possible to crash the Python interpreter with a sufficiently large/complex string due to stack depth limitations in Python's AST compiler.
Hence an iterable of "[(1,2), (3, 4)]" results in "[func(1,2), func(3,4)]".
During the next year, while still mostly working on it in my own time, Python was used in the Amoeba project with increasing success, and the feedback from colleagues made me add many early improvements.

The easiest way to do this is to use the "io.StringIO" class:
The application developer knows their target audience and what handlers are most appropriate for their application: if you add handlers 'under the hood', you might well interfere with their ability to carry out unit tests and deliver logs which suit their requirements.

For example, "fractions.Fraction" implements "hash()" as follows:
If the optional argument quotetabs is present and true, all tabs and spaces will be encoded
Run command with arguments and return its output.
If you tried to look up the old value it wouldn't be found either, because the value of the object found in that hash bin would be different.

"ValueError" will be raised on an invalid timespec argument:
Calling "reset_tzpath" will not invalidate the "ZoneInfo" cache, and so calls to the primary "ZoneInfo" constructor will only use the new "TZPATH" in the case of a cache miss.
File Objects
Do note that it is not required that all names returned by the iterator be actual resources, e.g. it is acceptable to return names for which "is_resource()" would be false.
This iterator will return all days (as "datetime.date" objects) for the month and all days before the start of the month or after the end of the month that are required to get a complete week.

The child process will block if it generates enough output to a pipe to fill up the OS pipe buffer as the pipes are not being read from.
Also, "partial" objects defined in classes behave like static methods and do not transform into bound methods during instance attribute look up.
You can specify stack_info independently of exc_info , e.g. to just show how you got to a certain point in your code, even when no exceptions were raised

A negative value N indicates that the child was terminated by signal N .
Library
Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.
Python supports this conversion in several ways: the "idna" codec performs conversion between Unicode and ACE, separating an input string into labels based on the separator characters defined in section 3.1 of RFC 3490 and converting each label to ACE as required, and conversely separating an input byte string into labels based on the "." separator and converting any ACE labels found into unicode

Return the "datetime" corresponding to the proleptic Gregorian ordinal, where January 1 of year 1 has ordinal 1
It is intended to be overridden by a derived class; the base class implementation does nothing.
Previously, the grammar was much more restrictive; see PEP 614 for details.
Inheritance
Introduction
They can also be used as a zero copy slicing mechanism
If the subpart has no Content Type header, no "charset" parameter, or is not of the text main MIME type, then that item in the returned list will be failobj .
Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language
If no offset follows dst, summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.
The term "CPython" is used when necessary to distinguish this implementation from others such as Jython or IronPython.
Simulate the effect of a "signal.SIGINT" signal arriving in the main thread
Changed in version 3.7: Recursion adds entries in sorted order.
This is helpful so that inputs created from "io.IOBase.readlines()" result in diffs that are suitable for use with "io.IOBase.writelines()" since both the inputs and outputs have trailing newlines.
Ttk Widgets
Changed in version 3.8: The sep and bytes_per_sep parameters were added.
And it means that symbols that should be accessible from other extension modules must be exported in a different way.
On Fedora and SuSE, it is equal to ""lib64"" on 64 bit platforms
For example, "[akm$]" will match any of the characters "'a'", "'k'", "'m'", or "'$'"; "'$'" is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class it's stripped of its special nature.
Feeding incomplete chunks to "feed()" works, but "handle_data()" might be called more than once (unless convert_charrefs is set to "True"):
Warning:
is equivalent to:
If this is not possible or desirable, the exception should be cleared by calling "PyErr_Clear()"
Both class and instance attributes are accessible through the notation ""self.name"", and an instance attribute hides a class attribute with the same name when accessed in this way
API and Feature Removals
To ensure the comprehension always results in a container of the appropriate type, "yield" and "yield from" expressions are prohibited in the implicitly nested scope.
You could assign the base class to an alias and derive from the alias
In general, you will want to use the "email" package's features to construct an email message, which you can then send via "send_message()"; see email: Examples.
When a target is part of a mutable object (an attribute reference, subscription or slicing), the mutable object must ultimately perform the assignment and decide about its validity, and may raise an exception if the assignment is unacceptable
Other Language Changes
The cmd variable must be a valid bourne shell command
Generators
For example, metaclass attributes are not in the result list when the argument is a class.
Developer Studio will throw in a lot of import libraries that you do not really need, adding about 100K to your executable

If a field is an "InitVar", it is considered a pseudo field called an init only field
This can be handled by writing a regular expression which matches an entire header line, and has one group which matches the header name, and another group which matches the header's value.
None is treated as an empty dict
"\" can be used to escape quotes:
A trailing newline is stripped from the output
If it is an integer, it represents the index of the positional argument in args ; if it is a string, then it represents a named argument in kwargs .
Invert all the digits in x .
Command history
This can be done by simply passing the dict and using square brackets "'[]'" to access the keys.
Here is an example of how you would catch one of these exceptions:
This module offers the following functions:
If lock is "False" then access to the returned object will not be automatically protected by a lock, so it will not necessarily be "process safe".
This represents the Thread ID ("TID") as assigned to the thread by the OS (kernel)
An "'AF_PIPE'" address is a string of the form "r'\.\pipe{PipeName}'"
Return a converted to an integer

If no "default" is provided, then the class attribute will be deleted
Changed in version 3.7: Added "COMMENT", "NL" and "ENCODING" tokens.
Editing and navigation

See also:
Those complement the existing "dict.update" and "{ d1, d2}" methods of merging dictionaries.
Further, pip and IDLE may be used by typing "pip" or "idle"
and the setup script might be
The column name found in "Cursor.description" does not include the type, i.e.if you use something like "'as "Expiration date [datetime]"'" in your SQL, then we will parse out everything until the first "'['" for the column name and strip the preceeding space: the column name would simply be "Expiration date".
Power and logarithmic functions
Note:
Note:
The "email.parser" module also provides "Parser" for parsing strings, and header only parsers, "BytesHeaderParser" and "HeaderParser", which can be used if you're only interested in the headers of the message
or, equivalently,
TarInfo Objects
"%I" Hour (12 hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12]
Here's an example of how you might use "message_from_bytes()" at an interactive Python prompt:
This is needed because the "field()" call itself replaces the normal position of the default value.
As you work on a functional style program, you'll write a number of functions with varying inputs and outputs
Cython can take advantage of compilation (and optional type annotations) to make your code significantly faster than when interpreted

use instances of "object" as the value
If the evaluation of an expression in the header of an except clause raises an exception, the original search for a handler is canceled and a search starts for the new exception in the surrounding code and on the call stack (it is treated as if the entire "try" statement raised the exception).
As with the "preamble", if there is no epilog text this attribute will be "None".
Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword only parameter.

Note:
For sequences, there is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random permutation of a list in place, and a function for random sampling without replacement.
See "extract()" note.
These lines can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.
They can also be enclosed in matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally referred to as triple quoted strings )
New Features
The original items do not have to be comparable because the ordering of the decorated tuples will be determined by at most the first two items
If override is true, existing pairs in a will be replaced if a matching key is found in b , otherwise pairs will only be added if there is not a matching key in a
It is aimed at the level of graphing and scientific calculators.

If you use dynamic loading, the details may depend on the style of dynamic loading your system uses; see the chapters about building extension modules (chapter Building C and C++ Extensions) and additional information that pertains only to building on Windows (chapter Building C and C++ Extensions on Windows) for more information about this.
(Its counterpart is the "program" mode, when the program is using curses capabilities.) Subsequent calls to "reset_shell_mode()" will restore this mode.
"_fields_" must be a list of 2 tuples , containing a field name and a field type .
This example uses "bisect()" to look up a letter grade for an exam score (say) based on a set of ordered numeric breakpoints: 90 and up is an 'A', 80 to 89 is a 'B', and so on:

Otherwise, turn debugging off
More on Lists
For example, a common idiom in Python is to loop over all elements of an iterable using a "for" statement
(Contributed by Johnny Najera in bpo 38944.)
So, a single positional argument with "dest 'bar'" will be referred to as "bar"
If the two operands are unequal, return the number closest to the first operand in the direction of the second operand
Return the path to an executable which would be run if the given cmd was called

Compiling Regular Expressions
You will receive an update each time action is taken on the bug.
Since 0.1 is not exactly representable in binary floating point, the value is stored as the nearest representable value which is 0x1.999999999999ap 4
You may also find version numbers with a "+" suffix, e.g. "2.2+"
You can use the more restricted definition of "\w" in a string pattern by supplying the "re.ASCII" flag when compiling the regular expression.
The decl parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside the "<!...>" markup (e.g. "'DOCTYPE html'").
The purpose of a module's spec is to encapsulate this import related information on a per module basis.

When "j" is positive, there are many, and in virtually all of them it's more useful for "i % j" to be "> 0"
For example:
The file name
The value of color_number must be between "0" and "COLORS"
Additional markers may be added in the future.
Objects of the "date" type are always naive.
However, assuming that "path" is a "str" and an absolute path, "open_code(path)" should always behave the same as "open(path, 'rb')"
The operator module
An "'AF_INET'" address is a tuple of the form "(hostname, port)" where hostname is a string and port is an integer.
For example, a pure Python implementation of "del d[n]" relies on the "rotate()" method to position elements to be popped:
Template strings
"create_autospec()" can also be used on classes, where it copies the signature of the "__init__" method, and on callable objects where it copies the signature of the "__call__" method.

PEP 3127: Integer Literal Support and Syntax
For simple input parsing, the easiest approach is usually to split the line into whitespace delimited words using the "split()" method of string objects and then convert decimal strings to numeric values using "int()" or "float()"
Raises "StatisticsError" if data has fewer than two values.
Data stream format
There were no new code changes in version 3.6.4 since v3.6.4rc1.
When annotating a variable or a class attribute, assignment is optional:
Its value represents offsets within the internal dictionary structure, and since the structure is sparse, the offsets are not consecutive.
If stop is "None", then iteration continues until the iterator is exhausted, if at all; otherwise, it stops at the specified position
The socket module now supports the "CAN_J1939" protocol on platforms that support it
Changed in version 3.3: Operations in this module now raise "OSError" where "IOError" was raised.

To make your own Enum's boolean evaluation depend on the member's value add the following to your class:
Raise OverflowError on infinities and ValueError on NaNs.
Two, the components to implement "import" are exposed in this package, making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known generically as an importer ) to participate in the import process.
In addition to the usual mapping methods, ordered dictionaries also support reverse iteration using "reversed()".
This method is called to process a named character reference of the form "&name;" (e.g. "&gt;"), where name is a general entity reference (e.g. "'gt'")
Changed in version 3.4: The new file descriptor is now non inheritable.

Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence
The module used to create and manage virtual environments is called "venv"
Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, named in a "global" statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a "nonlocal" statement), although they may be referenced.

which is exactly:
No item is added to "sys.path" more than once

So, if a foreign functions "restype" is a subclass of "c_void_p", you will receive an instance of this subclass from the function call
If the lock argument is given and not "None", it must be a "Lock" or "RLock" object, and it is used as the underlying lock
To begin the search, Python needs the fully qualified name of the module (or package, but for the purposes of this discussion, the difference is immaterial) being imported
Check PEP 11 for details on all unsupported platforms.
If file_or_dir is a directory and not a symbolic link, then recursively descend the directory tree named by file_or_dir , checking all ".py" files along the way

Summary Release highlights
Some of the input data may be preserved in internal buffers for later processing.
Derived Enumerations

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines , Tasks , and Futures .
Added "statistics.fmean()" as a faster, floating point variant of "statistics.mean()"
Jim Roskind suggests performing steps in the following order in each module:
Note:
Additionally, the Windows and Mac OS X installers for Python may include a copy of the OpenSSL libraries, so we include a copy of the OpenSSL license here:
The "import" statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope
Mark for refresh but wait
Most of the time, the attributes of the object returned by "parse_args()" will be fully determined by inspecting the command line arguments and the argument actions
Reserved classes of identifiers
Changed in version 3.4: The positional argument specifiers can be omitted for "Formatter".
On Unix, that means it begins with a slash, on Windows that it begins with a (back)slash after chopping off a potential drive letter.
For production rules with alternatives (aka "sums"), the left hand side class is abstract: only instances of specific constructor nodes are ever created.
The tarinfo argument can be used to replace the default "TarInfo" class with a different one.
Read commands from standard input ("sys.stdin")
All integers are implemented as "long" integer objects of arbitrary size.
The predicate must be a callable which result will be interpreted as a boolean value
The allowed range of floating point literals is implementation dependent
The simplest form for that information is a "network address/network prefix" pair, where the prefix defines the number of leading bits that are compared to determine whether or not an address is part of the network and the network address defines the expected value of those bits.
List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions:
If the generator function does not catch the passed in exception, or raises a different exception, then that exception propagates to the caller.
If a manager instance will be connected to the server using the "connect()" method, or if the create_method argument is "False" then this can be left as "None".

Base class for warnings about dubious syntax.
Reader and Writer must be factory functions or classes providing objects of the "StreamReader" and "StreamWriter" interface respectively.
This is ok, because it was implemented with knowledge of "A", so it can handle those instances before delegating to "Complex".
However, handling of "__del__()" methods is notoriously implementation specific, since it depends on internal details of the interpreter's garbage collector implementation.
Accessing "((char )buf)[0] up to ((char )buf)[len 1]" is only valid if the buffer has been obtained by a request that guarantees contiguity
Represents the C "signed int" datatype
Convert a tuple or "struct_time" representing a time as returned by "gmtime()" or "localtime()" to a string as specified by the format argument
However, unlike "Any", the reverse is not true: "object" is not a subtype of every other type.
File Descriptor Operations
The functions "PyNode_AddChild()" and "PyParser_AddToken()" now accept two additional "int" arguments end_lineno and end_col_offset .
Sequence Explanation unseen Not read, but previously detected by MUA replied Replied to flagged Marked as important

Math operations: "add()", "sub()", "mul()", "floordiv()", "abs()", ...
The length of the string is first unpacked as an unsigned integer, then the string data is unpacked with "unpack_fstring()".
In many cases, the finder and loader can be the same object; in such cases the "find_spec()" method would just return a spec with the loader set to "self".
